              </div>
                  <h6 class="list" style="text-align: left; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 1px;">Thank you for volunteering to teach the World’s Largest Lesson. Below you will fnd some of our top tips for teaching:<br><br>
                      <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Speak slowly and clearly<br>
                      <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Try and keep all your “teacher talk” (when you are speaking directly to students and they are just listening) to a<br>
                      maximum of 10 minutes at a time to keep students engaged<br>
                      <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Praise effort and progress - e.g <i>“I really like how hard you’ve tried to answer this question, I like how much effort<br>
                      you’ve put into working on this project today.”</i><br>
                      <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> We have found that using the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle can help students to understand the interdependence<br>
                      of the SDGs - <br>
                      <i>“Every single piece is important (just like every single Goal) because they all ft together and it cannot be<br>
                      complete without every single piece.”</i> (See <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 1</span>)<br>
                      <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Think about the reasons why you are teaching this lesson today and why you believe the SDGs are important<br>
                      and need to be shared with young people. Personal stories are the ones that stay with us the most so prepare<br>
                      a short anecdote or experience beforehand to share with your students.<br>
                      <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Smile and enjoy yourself!<br>
                      <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Your role is to facilitate. Make the lesson engaging and student-centered as much as you can.</h6>

                <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Familiarise yourself with the World’s Largest Lesson interactive map – as you will need to add your lesson to it.<br>
                <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Check with the class teacher beforehand on the class rules and expectations of<br>
                behaviour. Suggested questions to ask: How does the teacher signal to the students<br>
                to be quiet when he/she is speaking? Is there a class rewards system?<br>
                <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Print off the SDGs Grids (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 4</span>) - enough for each group to have one.<br>
                <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> Using sheets of paper, draw a large circular “country” shape. Ensure that the “country” extends over enough pieces<br>
                of paper for each group in the class to have one. To provide more guidance for students, you may want to draw a<br>
                road running the circumference of the country and/or label the outside space of country as the ocean.<br><br>
                <span style="color:  rgb(245, 150, 0)">•</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Below is a suggested approach to the activities for your lesson. In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 2</span> you will find<br>
                other variations to suggested activities or you may want to get creative and design your own!<br>

                      Tell students your name, where you’re from and which organisation you work for (if that’s relevant). Invite students<br>
                      to introduce themselves. This could take more time especially in an over-crowded classroom (devise a less time<br>
                      consuming approach in this case).<br><br>
                      Explain that you are here to talk about the Global Goals or or the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (these<br>
                      are the same thing). Ask students to raise their hands if they have heard these terms before. Select a few students<br>
                      to share their knowledge about the Goals with the rest of the class. If no-one has heard of the words “Sustainable<br>
                      Development Goals” before, reassure the class that they will all know the meaning by the end of the lesson.</h6>

        <h6 class="list" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1px; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="color:  rgb(0, 131, 173)">This activity is designed to provide an “entry point” to the Goals (either one Goal or a theme<br>
            from the Goals) that students can relate to rather than overwhelming them with all the Goals at<br>
            the same time. See <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 2</span> for alternative suggestions for running this activity.</span><br><br>
            Distribute around the room an unevenly divided number of marbles/stones/pieces of paper/sweets/<br>
            stickers. Some students should have a lot, some students just a few and some students have none.<br>
            Keep a majority for yourself. Ask the question: <i>“Is this fair?”</i> Encourage students to discuss this as a class.<br>
            Ask the students to discuss how they feel about the amount of objects they have. To spark<br>
            curiosity on sentiments and bias among these students, ask students reasons why you have<br>
            shared the resources in that manner (select another arbitrary criteria if this is not valid).<br><br>
            Ask students if they think this is fair and should you distribute the objects on this<br>
            basis. <i>What might be the most fair way of distributing the objects?</i><br>
            Introduce the idea of <span style="font-weight: bold;">social inequality</span>. <i>Ask the class if they have any idea what this might mean?</i><br><br>
            Tell the students that the SDGs have been created to reduce inequality across all aspects of life and to create<br>
            a world that is fair for everyone and where no-one is left behind. This is also relevant to all climate and planet<br>
            based Goals as the impact of climate and environmental change is felt most profoundly by those who are<br>
            less able to protect themselves from it. Ask students to remember what it felt like to receive a much smaller<br>
            proportion of the objects than others, and to remind themselves of that feeling throughout the lesson.<br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Social inequality:</span> <i>“a situation in which people are not equal because some groups have<br>
            more opportunities, power, money, etc than others”. (source: MacMillan dictionary)</i></h6>

              <h6 class="list" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1px; margin-top: 20px;">Explain to students that they are now going to watch an animation to learn more about the SDGs. Depending on their<br>
                  level of knowledge, this could be Animation Part 1 - an introduction to the Goals or Part 2 examples of different actions<br>
                  being taken around the world. <a href="http://worldslargestlesson.globalgoals.org/resources-for-teaching-the-sdgs-in-nigeria/" style="color: rgb(0, 131, 173);">http://worldslargestlesson.globalgoals.org/resources-for-teaching-the-sdgs-in-nigeria/</a><br><br>
                  Whilst watching the animation ask students to note down any words they don’t understand<br>
                  or questions they have about the Goals - you can go through these with them at the end of the film.<br><br>
                  If learning about the SDGs for the frst time, students may have lots of questions about these which you may not know<br>
                  the answers to (particularly why they need to be involved). Try and answer these questions as best you can and if you<br>
                  don’t know the answer direct students to the SDGs website to fnd out more or challenge students to fnd out their own<br>
                  answers after the session!<br><br>
                  Show students a picture or a video of a United Nations Assembly that depicts where every country (including Nigeria)<br>

                    <h6 class="list" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 1px; margin-top: 20px;">To further connect the SDGs to their personal experience, ask students<br>
                        <i>how old are they going to be in 2030? Why is the year 2030 important?</i><br><br>
                        At that time they might be of a working age. Ask students to think (individually) pair (talk to the person next to them)<br>
                        and share (talk to the whole class) about <i>what they might be doing in 2030, want job might they have, what would<br>
                        they like to study or how will they spend their time?<br><br>
                        How do you think we could relate your future life to the SDGs?</i> – Ask students to think about what aspects of their<br>
                        prospective jobs would relate to the SDGs. Eg. if students wanted to be a teacher that would help to achieve Goal 4.</h6>

                        this activity, take the opportunity to walk around the class. Students will be very curious to learn more<br>
                        about you as well as your personal connection to the Goals. Share your perspective with them and ask<br>
                        them to tell you a bit more about themselves and their interest in the SDGs. This is a great chance to<br>
                        ask opinions on the Goals and whether students feel they do or don’t connect to their daily lives.</i><br><br>
                        Explain to students that they are now going to complete a group learning activity. Divide the class into<br>
                        groups of 3-5 students (dependent on size of the class) and explain that the main task today is to design<br>
                        a SDGs country - where each group will draw their own vision of what a country would like in 2030 if the<br>
                        Goals are achieved. Ask the class to discuss in their groups <i>what facilities and infrastructures a country<br>
                        might need to look after its population, environment and natural resources? E.g schools, hospitals, water<br>
                        sources, waste management systems, safe roads.</i> Take some suggestions from different groups.<br><br>
                        Show students the large pieces of paper you have drawn earlier. Explain that each group will have a piece<br>
                        to draw their SDGs country map on - these pieces will then be joined together at the end of the session<br>
                        to the see the completed country as a whole - see the image in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 3</span> for an example of this.<br>
                        Ensure each group has a SDGs grid (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 4</span>) and the One Sentence Goal Descriptions<br>
                        sheet (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 5</span>) or display these on the board as a “checklist” so students try to<br>
                        design a country that has facilities and infrastructure that will achieve each Goal.
                        If students need some more support - ask the suggested prompt questions in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix 6.</span></h6>

                                          questions about any of the Goals students might have missed. For example usually students think first<br>
                                          about the practicalities of designing a country e.g water sources and schools. But use this opportunity to ask<br>
                                          questions that will promote deeper thinking from students on issues surround inclusion and community - e.g<br>
                                          <i>What in their maps of their SDGs country promotes health and well-being? How will they make sure that they<br>

                    Another “starting point” for the lesson might be to focus on Gender Equality. If so you could tell all the male students<br>
                    that they have to sit on the ﬂoor, whilst all the female students can sit on chairs. Or explain that all the male students<br>
                    when they have an idea to share with the class, will have to tell it to a female classmate frst who will then speak<br>
                    on their behalf. Other ideas include only taking questions/ideas from male students and seeing if the class notices.<br>
                    How does this make students feel? Is this fair? Invite students to suggest how you could have acted differently?<br><br>
                    This can open a class discussion about Goal 5 and how it aims to achieve gender equality<br>

                          2. The SDGs can be roughly divided into different sections - can you work out what these might be - e.g environment/<br>
                          human/ living in cities </i>- this might help students to identify the group of goals they particularly care about<br>
                          3. <i>Are there any Goals that you think are particularly important to young people? Are their any goals missing?<br>
                          4. Think about where you live. Maybe there are some features that are unique to your community, maybe there are<br>
                          other aspects that the community could do better </i>- eg. recycling - <i>what links to the SDGs are there here?<br>
                          5. Are there any Goals that you think might be easier to achieve than others?<br>
                          6. Are there any Goals that you think your country or community is particularly good at or could improve?<br>
                          7. Are there any Goals that you think are not relevant to you/ your country?</i> Every Goal is relevant to every country and<br>
                          this question can lead to a discussion about how the SDGs are for everyone everywhere.<br>
                          8. <i>Are there any Goals your school is working to achieve without even realising it?</i> E.g Goal 12 by including a<br>
                          recycling bin in school classrooms.<br>
                          9. <i>Are there any SDGs that you are working towards at home without even realising it?</i> - This question will help<br>
                          students to see that they might already be contributing to the Goals e.g by ensuring you eat healthy and nutritious<br>
                          meals at home - Goal 3<br>
                          10. <i>If we achieved Goal 1 - what effect would that have on other SDGs?</i> - Discussion to help students to understand<br>
                          that all the SDGs are interconnected like pieces of a puzzle.<br>
