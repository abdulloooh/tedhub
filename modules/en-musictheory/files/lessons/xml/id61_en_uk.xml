		<gotoAndStop label="start" />
		<text>While root position and first inversion triads can be used freely, second inversion usually occurs only in three situations.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="passing" />
		<text>Like first inversion, second inversion may be used to smooth out a bass line.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="passing2" />
		<text>Look at the above example - notice the movement of the bass line.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="passing3" />
		<text>By placing the <b>V</b> chord in second inversion, the bass line moves by step and becomes smooth.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="passing4" />
		<text>When used in this fashion, a second inversion triad is called a <b>passing six-four chord</b>.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="passing5" />
		<text>Listen to the above examples.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="pedal" />
		<text>Second inversion may also be used to straighten a bass line.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="pedal2" />
		<text>Look at the above example - notice how the bass line jumps up to the F and then returns back to C.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="pedal3" />
		<text>By placing the <b>IV</b> chord in second inversion, all movement in the bass line is eliminated.</text>	
		<gotoAndStop label="pedal4" />
		<text>When used in this fashion, a second inversion triad is called a <b>pedal six-four chord</b>.</text>	
		<gotoAndPlay label="pedal5" />
		<text>Listen to the above examples.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="cadential" />
		<text>The <b>cadential six-four chord</b> is the final and most noticeable use of second inversion.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="cadential2" />
		<text>In this form, the second inversion triad preceeds a <b>V</b> chord in a cadence.  Often, the cadence will sound stronger due to the cadential six-four's presence.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="cadential3" />
		<text>Listen to the above example.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndPlay label="chart" />
		<text>On the chord progression chart, the cadential six-four occurs in between a predominant and dominant.</text>
