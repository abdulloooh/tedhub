		<gotoAndStop label="start" />
		<text>Composers will often arrange the notes of a chord in numerous ways in order to vary its sound.  This process is called <b>voicing</b>.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="root_position" />
		<text>To demonstrate this, we will voice an F major triad.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="root_position2" />
		<text>Notice that we can arrange the notes in any order as long as F, A, and C are used and F is the lowest note.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="root_position3" />
		<text>Listen to the above examples.</text>
	</section>

	<section>
		<gotoAndPlay label="first_inversion" />
		<text>Next, we will voice an F major triad in first inversion.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="first_inversion2" />
		<text>By definition, a chord is in first inversion when the third is the lowest note.  Thus, we need to make sure that each of our voicings uses A for the bottom note.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="first_inversion3" />
		<text>Listen to the above examples.</text>
	</section>

	<section>
		<gotoAndPlay label="second_inversion" />
		<text>Finally, we will voice an F major triad in second inversion.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="second_inversion2" />
		<text>The process is the same; however, we must be certain that the fifth (C) is used as the lowest note.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="second_inversion3" />
		<text>Listen to the final examples.</text>
