		<text>In this analysis, we will be examining measures 48-50 of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata (Opus 27, Number 2, Movement 1).</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="key" />
		<text>Since we are starting in the middle of the piece, I will give you a hint: it is in C# minor.</text>

		<gotoAndPlay label="group_one" />
		<text>The first half of measure 48 contains G#'s, B#'s, D#'s, and F#'s - a G# dominant seventh chord.  Since the B# is the lowest note, the chord is in first inversion.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="group_two" />
		<text>The second half of measure 48 contains C#'s, E's, and G#'s - a C# minor triad.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="group_three" />
		<text>The first half of measure 49 contains D's, F#'s, and A's - a D major triad in first inversion.  This is the Neapolitan sixth chord in C# minor.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="group_four" />
		<text>The second half of measure 49 contains G#'s, B#'s, and F#'s - a G# dominant seventh chord with a missing fifth.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="group_five" />
		<text>The first part of measure 50 contains C#'s, E's, and G#'s - another C# minor triad.</text>
