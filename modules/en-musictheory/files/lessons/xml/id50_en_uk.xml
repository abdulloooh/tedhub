	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="start" />
		<text>Unlike the major scale, three different minor scales exist.</text>
		<text>Composers will often merge two of these scales - natural minor and harmonic minor - for a more pleasing sound.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndPlay label="triads" />
		<text>Recall the diatonic triads of both scales.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="triads2" />
		<text>Notice that many of the triads are the same.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="triads3" />
		<text>Three pairs of triads (<b>III</b>, <b>III+</b>), (<b>v</b>, <b>V</b>), (<b>VII</b>, <b>viiº</b>) are different due to harmonic minor's raised seventh degree.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndPlay label="III" />
		<text>III is always used instead of III+.  This is because III+, being an augmented chord, has a peculiar sound.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="V" />
		<text>Because it contains a leading tone (and therefore is stronger), <b>V</b> is preferred to <b>v</b>.  This does not mean that <b>v</b> cannot be used.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="VII" />
		<text><b>VII</b> and <b>viiº</b> are both used equally.  As you will later learn, each has a different function.</text>
	</section>

	<section>
		<gotoAndPlay label="merged" />
		<text>As you can see, the merged minor scale contains nine different diatonic triads.</text>
