		<gotoAndStop label="start" />
		<text>Each time signature can be classified into a certain <b>meter</b>.</text>
		<text>The terms <b>duple</b>, <b>triple</b>, and <b>quadruple</b> refer to the number of beats in a bar.</text>
		<text>The term <b>simple</b> means that each of these beats can be broken into two notes.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>	
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_duple" />
		<text>For example, 2/4 time is classified as <b>simple duple</b>.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_duple2" />
		<text>"Duple" refers to the two beats per bar.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_duple3" />
		<text>"Simple" states that each of these beats can be divided into two notes.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_duple4" />
		<text>2/2 and 2/8 are also simple duple.</text>
	</section>	 
		
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_triple" />
		<text>3/4 time is classified as <b>simple triple</b>.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_triple2" />
		<text>"Triple" refers to the three beats per bar.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_triple3" />
		<text>Again, "simple" states that each of these beats can be divided into two notes.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_triple4" />
		<text>3/2 and 3/8 are also simple triple.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_quadruple" />
		<text>4/4 time is classified as simple quadruple due to its four beats which can be divided into two notes.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="simple_quadruple2" />
		<text>4/2 and 4/8 are also simple quadruple.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="top_number" />
		<text>Notice that a time signature in simple meter will always have a 2, 3, or 4 for the top number.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound" />
		<text>While beats in simple meter are divided into two notes, beats in compound meter are divided into three.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound2" />
		<text>To demonstrate this, we will examine 6/8 time.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound3" />
		<text>Notice that the six quaver notes can either be divided into two beats (<b>compound duple</b>) or three beats (<b>simple triple</b>).</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound4" />
		<text>Since the simple triple pattern already belongs to 3/4 time, 6/8 is compound duple.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound5" />
		<text>Notice that each beat in 6/8 is a dotted crotchet note.  In fact, all compound meters will have some dotted note as its beat.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound6" />
		<text>Any time signature with a 6 on top is compound duple.  Of the above time signatures, 6/8 and 6/4 are the most commonly used.</text>
	</section>

	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound_triple" />
		<text>9/8 time is classified as <b>compound triple</b>.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound_triple2" />
		<text>There are three beats (three dotted crotchet notes), thus making the meter triple.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound_triple3" />
		<text>Since each beat is comprised of three notes, the meter is compound.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound_triple4" />
		<text>Any time signature with a 9 on top is compound triple.  Although 9/8 is the most common; 9/2, 9/4, and 9/16 can also be used.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound_quadruple" />
		<text>Finally, 12/8 time is classified as <b>compound quadruple</b>.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound_quadruple2" />
		<text>There are four beats, thus making the meter quadruple.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound_quadruple3" />
		<text>Since each beat is comprised of three notes, the meter is compound.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="compound_quadruple4" />
		<text>Any time signature with a 12 on top is compound quadruple.  Of the above time signatures, 12/8 and 12/16 are the most commonly used.</text>
