        <text><b>Augmentation dots</b> and <b>tenuto ties</b> are two types of markings used to alter a note's duration.</text>
        <gotoAndStop label="dot" />
        <text>A dot increases duration by one half.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="dot2" />
        <text>Since an eighth note is half the duration of a quarter note, we will substitute it for the 1/2 symbol above.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="dot3" />
		<text>As you can see, a dotted quarter note is equal to a quarter note plus an eighth note.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="dot4" />
		<text>A dotted quarter can also equal three eighth notes.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="tie" />
		<text>Ties merge multiple notes of the same pitch.  They are used to let the duration of a note travel across barriers (such as the measure line in the above example).</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="tie2" />
		<text>As you listen, notice how the fourth and fifth note are combined.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="tie3" />
		<text>If the measure line was not there, we could have simply written a half note for the tied quarter notes.</text>

    	<text>Use the above chart for reference to augmentation dots.</text>
