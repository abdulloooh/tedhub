	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="start" />
		<text>The length of time that a note is played is called its <b>note duration</b>, which is determined by the type of note.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="whole" />
		<text>The <b>semibreve</b> has the longest note duration in modern music.</text>
	</section>

	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="half" />
		<text>The <b>minim</b> has half the duration of a semibreve.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="half2" />
		<text>Two minims occupy the same amount of time as one semibreve.</text>
	</section>

	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="quarter" />
		<text>The <b>crotchet note</b> is a fourth (or a quarter) of a semibreve.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="quarter2" />
		<text>Four crotchet notes occupy the same amount of time as one semibreve.  Two crotchets equal the duration of a minim.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="flag" />
		<text>Notes smaller in duration than a crotchet have <b>flags</b>.  Each flag halves the value of a note.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="eighth" />
		<text>A <b>quaver note</b> has one flag; therefore, it is half the value of a crotchet.</text>
		<gotoAndPlay label="sixteenth" />
		<text>A <b>semiquaver note</b> has two flags, halving the value again.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="3ormore" />
		<text>Although it is possible to have notes with three or more flags, they are seldomly used.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="chart" />
		<text>The above chart displays the relationship of all five note types discussed in this lesson.</text>
