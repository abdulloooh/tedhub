		<text>An <b>odd meter</b> is a meter which contains both simple and compound beats.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd1" />
		<text>The first odd meter that we will discuss is 5/8 time.  It contains one simple beat and one compound.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd2" />
		<text>The order of the beats does not matter.  If the compound beat comes first, it is still 5/8 time.</text>
	</section>

	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd3" />
		<text>Next, we will discuss odd meters with three total beats.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd4" />
		<text>7/8 time contains two simple beats and one compound beat.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd5" />
		<text>Again, the order of the beats does not matter.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd6" />
		<text>The compound beat can even be positioned between two simple beats.</text>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd7" />
		<text>8/8 time contains two compound beats and one simple beat.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd8" />
		<text>Sometimes, people confuse 8/8 with 4/4, since both meters have 8 eighth notes.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd9" />
		<text>Notice that 4/4 divides the meter into four beats of two eight notes (simple quadruple), while 8/8 divides it into three odd beats.</text>
	</section>

	<section>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd10" />
		<text>Our last two odd meters have a total of four beats.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd11" />
		<text>10/8 time has two compound beats and two simple beats.</text>
		<gotoAndStop label="odd12" />
		<text>11/8 time has three compound beats and one simple beat.</text>
