<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;ANCIENT ENGLAND AND THE ROMANS</h2>
<p>If you look at a Map of the World, you will see, in the 
left-hand upper corner of the Eastern Hemisphere, two Islands 
lying in the sea.&nbsp; They are England and Scotland, and 
Ireland.&nbsp; England and Scotland form the greater part of 
these Islands.&nbsp; Ireland is the next in size.&nbsp; The 
little neighbouring islands, which are so small upon the Map as 
to be mere dots, are chiefly little bits of 
Scotland,&mdash;broken off, I dare say, in the course of a great 
length of time, by the power of the restless water.</p>
<p>In the old days, a long, long while ago, before Our Saviour 
was born on earth and lay asleep in a manger, these Islands were 
in the same place, and the stormy sea roared round them, just as 
it roars now.&nbsp; But the sea was not alive, then, with great 
ships and brave sailors, sailing to and from all parts of the 
world.&nbsp; It was very lonely.&nbsp; The Islands lay solitary, 
in the great expanse of water.&nbsp; The foaming waves dashed 
against their cliffs, and the bleak winds blew over their 
forests; but the winds and waves brought no adventurers to land 
upon the Islands, and the savage Islanders knew nothing of the 
rest of the world, and the rest of the world knew nothing of 
them.</p>
<p>It is supposed that the Ph&oelig;nicians, who were an ancient 
people, famous for carrying on trade, came in ships to these 
Islands, and found that they produced tin and lead; both very 
useful things, as you know, and both produced to this very hour 
upon the sea-coast. The most celebrated tin mines in Cornwall 
are, still, close to the sea.&nbsp; One of them, which I have 
seen, is so close to it that it is hollowed out underneath the 
ocean; and the miners say, that in stormy weather, when they are 
at work down in that deep place, they can hear the noise of the 
waves thundering above their heads.&nbsp; So, the 
Ph&oelig;nicians, coasting about the Islands, would come, without
much difficulty, to where the tin and lead were.</p>
<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians traded with the Islanders for these 
metals, and gave the Islanders some other useful things in 
exchange.&nbsp; The Islanders were, at first, poor savages, going
almost naked, or only dressed in the rough skins of beasts, and 
staining their bodies, as other savages do, with coloured earths 
and the juices of plants.&nbsp; But the Ph&oelig;nicians, sailing
over to the opposite coasts of France and Belgium, and saying to 
the people there, &lsquo;We have been to those white cliffs 
across the water, which you can see in fine weather, and from 
that country, which is called <span class="smcap">Britain</span>,
we bring this tin and lead,&rsquo; tempted some of the French and
Belgians to come over also.&nbsp; These people settled themselves
on the south coast of England, which is now called Kent; and, 
although they were a rough people too, they taught the savage 
Britons some useful arts, and improved that part of the 
Islands.&nbsp; It is probable that other people came over from 
Spain to Ireland, and settled there.</p>
<p>Thus, by little and little, strangers became mixed with the 
Islanders, and the savage Britons grew into a wild, bold people; 
almost savage, still, especially in the interior of the country 
away from the sea where the foreign settlers seldom went; but 
hardy, brave, and strong.</p>
<p>The whole country was covered with forests, and swamps.&nbsp; 
The greater part of it was very misty and cold.&nbsp; There were 
no roads, no bridges, no streets, no houses that you would think 
deserving of the name.&nbsp; A town was nothing but a collection 
of straw-covered huts, hidden in a thick wood, with a ditch all 
round, and a low wall, made of mud, or the trunks of trees placed
one upon another.&nbsp; The people planted little or no corn, but
lived upon the flesh of their flocks and cattle.&nbsp; They made 
no coins, but used metal rings for money.&nbsp; They were clever 
in basket-work, as savage people often are; and they could make a
coarse kind of cloth, and some very bad earthenware.&nbsp; But in
building fortresses they were much more clever.</p>
<p>They made boats of basket-work, covered with the skins of 
animals, but seldom, if ever, ventured far from the shore.&nbsp; 
They made swords, of copper mixed with tin; but, these swords 
were of an awkward shape, and so soft that a heavy blow would 
bend one.&nbsp; They made light shields, short pointed daggers, 
and spears&mdash;which they jerked back after they had thrown 
them at an enemy, by a long strip of leather fastened to the 
stem.&nbsp; The butt-end was a rattle, to frighten an 
enemy&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; The ancient Britons, being divided 
into as many as thirty or forty tribes, each commanded by its own
little king, were constantly fighting with one another, as savage
people usually do; and they always fought with these weapons.</p>
<p>They were very fond of horses.&nbsp; The standard of Kent was 
the picture of a white horse.&nbsp; They could break them in and 
manage them wonderfully well.&nbsp; Indeed, the horses (of which 
they had an abundance, though they were rather small) were so 
well taught in those days, that they can scarcely be said to have
improved since; though the men are so much wiser.&nbsp; They 
understood, and obeyed, every word of command; and would stand 
still by themselves, in all the din and noise of battle, while 
their masters went to fight on foot.&nbsp; The Britons could not 
have succeeded in their most remarkable art, without the aid of 
these sensible and trusty animals.&nbsp; The art I mean, is the 
construction and management of war-chariots or cars, for which 
they have ever been celebrated in history.&nbsp; Each of the best
sort of these chariots, not quite breast high in front, and open 
at the back, contained one man to drive, and two or three others 
to fight&mdash;all standing up.&nbsp; The horses who drew them 
were so well trained, that they would tear, at full gallop, over 
the most stony ways, and even through the woods; dashing down 
their masters&rsquo; enemies beneath their hoofs, and cutting 
them to pieces with the blades of swords, or scythes, which were 
fastened to the wheels, and stretched out beyond the car on each 
side, for that cruel purpose.&nbsp; In a moment, while at full 
speed, the horses would stop, at the driver&rsquo;s 
command.&nbsp; The men within would leap out, deal blows about 
them with their swords like hail, leap on the horses, on the 
pole, spring back into the chariots anyhow; and, as soon as they 
were safe, the horses tore away again.</p>
<p>The Britons had a strange and terrible religion, called the 
Religion of the Druids.&nbsp; It seems to have been brought over,
in very early times indeed, from the opposite country of France, 
anciently called Gaul, and to have mixed up the worship of the 
Serpent, and of the Sun and Moon, with the worship of some of the
Heathen Gods and Goddesses.&nbsp; Most of its ceremonies were 
kept secret by the priests, the Druids, who pretended to be 
enchanters, and who carried magicians&rsquo; wands, and wore, 
each of them, about his neck, what he told the ignorant people 
was a Serpent&rsquo;s egg in a golden case.&nbsp; But it is 
certain that the Druidical ceremonies included the sacrifice of 
human victims, the torture of some suspected criminals, and, on 
particular occasions, even the burning alive, in immense wicker 
cages, of a number of men and animals together.&nbsp; The Druid 
Priests had some kind of veneration for the Oak, and for the 
mistletoe&mdash;the same plant that we hang up in houses at 
Christmas Time now&mdash;when its white berries grew upon the 
Oak.&nbsp; They met together in dark woods, which they called 
Sacred Groves; and there they instructed, in their mysterious 
arts, young men who came to them as pupils, and who sometimes 
stayed with them as long as twenty years.</p>
<p>These Druids built great Temples and altars, open to the sky, 
fragments of some of which are yet remaining.&nbsp; Stonehenge, 
on Salisbury Plain, in Wiltshire, is the most extraordinary of 
these.&nbsp; Three curious stones, called Kits Coty House, on 
Bluebell Hill, near Maidstone, in Kent, form another.&nbsp; We 
know, from examination of the great blocks of which such 
buildings are made, that they could not have been raised without 
the aid of some ingenious machines, which are common now, but 
which the ancient Britons certainly did not use in making their 
own uncomfortable houses.&nbsp; I should not wonder if the 
Druids, and their pupils who stayed with them twenty years, 
knowing more than the rest of the Britons, kept the people out of
sight while they made these buildings, and then pretended that 
they built them by magic.&nbsp; Perhaps they had a hand in the 
fortresses too; at all events, as they were very powerful, and 
very much believed in, and as they made and executed the laws, 
and paid no taxes, I don&rsquo;t wonder that they liked their 
trade.&nbsp; And, as they persuaded the people the more Druids 
there were, the better off the people would be, I don&rsquo;t 
wonder that there were a good many of them.&nbsp; But it is 
pleasant to think that there are no Druids, <i>now</i>, who go on
in that way, and pretend to carry Enchanters&rsquo; Wands and 
Serpents&rsquo; Eggs&mdash;and of course there is nothing of the 
kind, anywhere.</p>
<p>Such was the improved condition of the ancient Britons, 
fifty-five years before the birth of Our Saviour, when the 
Romans, under their great General, Julius C&aelig;sar, were 
masters of all the rest of the known world.&nbsp; Julius 
C&aelig;sar had then just conquered Gaul; and hearing, in Gaul, a
good deal about the opposite Island with the white cliffs, and 
about the bravery of the Britons who inhabited it&mdash;some of 
whom had been fetched over to help the Gauls in the war against 
him&mdash;he resolved, as he was so near, to come and conquer 
Britain next.</p>
<p>So, Julius C&aelig;sar came sailing over to this Island of 
ours, with eighty vessels and twelve thousand men.&nbsp; And he 
came from the French coast between Calais and Boulogne, 
&lsquo;because thence was the shortest passage into 
Britain;&rsquo; just for the same reason as our steam-boats now 
take the same track, every day.&nbsp; He expected to conquer 
Britain easily: but it was not such easy work as he 
supposed&mdash;for the bold Britons fought most bravely; and, 
what with not having his horse-soldiers with him (for they had 
been driven back by a storm), and what with having some of his 
vessels dashed to pieces by a high tide after they were drawn 
ashore, he ran great risk of being totally defeated.&nbsp; 
However, for once that the bold Britons beat him, he beat them 
twice; though not so soundly but that he was very glad to accept 
their proposals of peace, and go away.</p>
<p>But, in the spring of the next year, he came back; this time, 
with eight hundred vessels and thirty thousand men.&nbsp; The 
British tribes chose, as their general-in-chief, a Briton, whom 
the Romans in their Latin language called <span 
class="smcap">Cassivellaunus</span>, but whose British name is 
supposed to have been <span class="smcap">Caswallon</span>.&nbsp;
A brave general he was, and well he and his soldiers fought the 
Roman army!&nbsp; So well, that whenever in that war the Roman 
soldiers saw a great cloud of dust, and heard the rattle of the 
rapid British chariots, they trembled in their hearts.&nbsp; 
Besides a number of smaller battles, there was a battle fought 
near Canterbury, in Kent; there was a battle fought near 
Chertsey, in Surrey; there was a battle fought near a marshy 
little town in a wood, the capital of that part of Britain which 
belonged to <span class="smcap">Cassivellaunus</span>, and which 
was probably near what is now Saint Albans, in 
Hertfordshire.&nbsp; However, brave <span 
class="smcap">Cassivellaunus</span> had the worst of it, on the 
whole; though he and his men always fought like lions.&nbsp; As 
the other British chiefs were jealous of him, and were always 
quarrelling with him, and with one another, he gave up, and 
proposed peace.&nbsp; Julius C&aelig;sar was very glad to grant 
peace easily, and to go away again with all his remaining ships 
and men.&nbsp; He had expected to find pearls in Britain, and he 
may have found a few for anything I know; but, at all events, he 
found delicious oysters, and I am sure he found tough 
Britons&mdash;of whom, I dare say, he made the same complaint as 
Napoleon Bonaparte the great French General did, eighteen hundred
years afterwards, when he said they were such unreasonable 
fellows that they never knew when they were beaten.&nbsp; They 
never <i>did</i> know, I believe, and never will.</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred years passed on, and all that time, there was
peace in Britain.&nbsp; The Britons improved their towns and mode
of life: became more civilised, travelled, and learnt a great 
deal from the Gauls and Romans.&nbsp; At last, the Roman Emperor,
Claudius, sent <span class="smcap">Aulus Plautius</span>, a 
skilful general, with a mighty force, to subdue the Island, and 
shortly afterwards arrived himself.&nbsp; They did little; and 
<span class="smcap">Ostorius Scapula</span>, another general, 
came.&nbsp; Some of the British Chiefs of Tribes submitted.&nbsp;
Others resolved to fight to the death.&nbsp; Of these brave men, 
the bravest was <span class="smcap">Caractacus</span>, or <span 
class="smcap">Caradoc</span>, who gave battle to the Romans, with
his army, among the mountains of North Wales.&nbsp; &lsquo;This 
day,&rsquo; said he to his soldiers, &lsquo;decides the fate of 
Britain!&nbsp; Your liberty, or your eternal slavery, dates from 
this hour.&nbsp; Remember your brave ancestors, who drove the 
great C&aelig;sar himself across the sea!&rsquo;&nbsp; On hearing
these words, his men, with a great shout, rushed upon the 
Romans.&nbsp; But the strong Roman swords and armour were too 
much for the weaker British weapons in close conflict.&nbsp; The 
Britons lost the day.&nbsp; The wife and daughter of the brave 
<span class="smcap">Caractacus</span> were taken prisoners; his 
brothers delivered themselves up; he himself was betrayed into 
the hands of the Romans by his false and base stepmother: and 
they carried him, and all his family, in triumph to Rome.</p>
<p>But a great man will be great in misfortune, great in prison, 
great in chains.&nbsp; His noble air, and dignified endurance of 
distress, so touched the Roman people who thronged the streets to
see him, that he and his family were restored to freedom.&nbsp; 
No one knows whether his great heart broke, and he died in Rome, 
or whether he ever returned to his own dear country.&nbsp; 
English oaks have grown up from acorns, and withered away, when 
they were hundreds of years old&mdash;and other oaks have sprung 
up in their places, and died too, very aged&mdash;since the rest 
of the history of the brave <span class="smcap">Caractacus</span>
was forgotten.</p>
<p>Still, the Britons <i>would not</i> yield.&nbsp; They rose 
again and again, and died by thousands, sword in hand.&nbsp; They
rose, on every possible occasion.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Suetonius</span>, another Roman general, came, and 
stormed the Island of Anglesey (then called <span 
class="smcap">Mona</span>), which was supposed to be sacred, and 
he burnt the Druids in their own wicker cages, by their own 
fires.&nbsp; But, even while he was in Britain, with his 
victorious troops, the <span class="smcap">Britons</span> 
rose.&nbsp; Because <span class="smcap">Boadicea</span>, a 
British queen, the widow of the King of the Norfolk and Suffolk 
people, resisted the plundering of her property by the Romans who
were settled in England, she was scourged, by order of <span 
class="smcap">Catus</span> a Roman officer; and her two daughters
were shamefully insulted in her presence, and her husband&rsquo;s
relations were made slaves.&nbsp; To avenge this injury, the 
Britons rose, with all their might and rage.&nbsp; They drove 
<span class="smcap">Catus</span> into Gaul; they laid the Roman 
possessions waste; they forced the Romans out of London, then a 
poor little town, but a trading place; they hanged, burnt, 
crucified, and slew by the sword, seventy thousand Romans in a 
few days.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Suetonius</span> strengthened
his army, and advanced to give them battle.&nbsp; They 
strengthened their army, and desperately attacked his, on the 
field where it was strongly posted.&nbsp; Before the first charge
of the Britons was made, <span class="smcap">Boadicea</span>, in 
a war-chariot, with her fair hair streaming in the wind, and her 
injured daughters lying at her feet, drove among the troops, and 
cried to them for vengeance on their oppressors, the licentious 
Romans.&nbsp; The Britons fought to the last; but they were 
vanquished with great slaughter, and the unhappy queen took 
poison.</p>
<p>Still, the spirit of the Britons was not broken.&nbsp; When 
<span class="smcap">Suetonius</span> left the country, they fell 
upon his troops, and retook the Island of Anglesey.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Agricola</span> came, fifteen or twenty years 
afterwards, and retook it once more, and devoted seven years to 
subduing the country, especially that part of it which is now 
called <span class="smcap">Scotland</span>; but, its people, the 
Caledonians, resisted him at every inch of ground.&nbsp; They 
fought the bloodiest battles with him; they killed their very 
wives and children, to prevent his making prisoners of them; they
fell, fighting, in such great numbers that certain hills in 
Scotland are yet supposed to be vast heaps of stones piled up 
above their graves.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Hadrian</span> 
came, thirty years afterwards, and still they resisted him.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Severus</span> came, nearly a hundred years 
afterwards, and they worried his great army like dogs, and 
rejoiced to see them die, by thousands, in the bogs and 
swamps.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Caracalla</span>, the son and 
successor of <span class="smcap">Severus</span>, did the most to 
conquer them, for a time; but not by force of arms.&nbsp; He knew
how little that would do.&nbsp; He yielded up a quantity of land 
to the Caledonians, and gave the Britons the same privileges as 
the Romans possessed.&nbsp; There was peace, after this, for 
seventy years.</p>
<p>Then new enemies arose.&nbsp; They were the Saxons, a fierce, 
sea-faring people from the countries to the North of the Rhine, 
the great river of Germany on the banks of which the best grapes 
grow to make the German wine.&nbsp; They began to come, in pirate
ships, to the sea-coast of Gaul and Britain, and to plunder 
them.&nbsp; They were repulsed by <span 
class="smcap">Carausius</span>, a native either of Belgium or of 
Britain, who was appointed by the Romans to the command, and 
under whom the Britons first began to fight upon the sea.&nbsp; 
But, after this time, they renewed their ravages.&nbsp; A few 
years more, and the Scots (which was then the name for the people
of Ireland), and the Picts, a northern people, began to make 
frequent plundering incursions into the South of Britain.&nbsp; 
All these attacks were repeated, at intervals, during two hundred
years, and through a long succession of Roman Emperors and 
chiefs; during all which length of time, the Britons rose against
the Romans, over and over again.&nbsp; At last, in the days of 
the Roman <span class="smcap">Honorius</span>, when the Roman 
power all over the world was fast declining, and when Rome wanted
all her soldiers at home, the Romans abandoned all hope of 
conquering Britain, and went away.&nbsp; And still, at last, as 
at first, the Britons rose against them, in their old brave 
manner; for, a very little while before, they had turned away the
Roman magistrates, and declared themselves an independent 
people.</p>
<p>Five hundred years had passed, since Julius 
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s first invasion of the Island, when the Romans
departed from it for ever.&nbsp; In the course of that time, 
although they had been the cause of terrible fighting and 
bloodshed, they had done much to improve the condition of the 
Britons.&nbsp; They had made great military roads; they had built
forts; they had taught them how to dress, and arm themselves, 
much better than they had ever known how to do before; they had 
refined the whole British way of living.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Agricola</span> had built a great wall of earth, 
more than seventy miles long, extending from Newcastle to beyond 
Carlisle, for the purpose of keeping out the Picts and Scots; 
<span class="smcap">Hadrian</span> had strengthened it; <span 
class="smcap">Severus</span>, finding it much in want of repair, 
had built it afresh of stone.</p>
<p>Above all, it was in the Roman time, and by means of Roman 
ships, that the Christian Religion was first brought into 
Britain, and its people first taught the great lesson that, to be
good in the sight of <span class="smcap">God</span>, they must 
love their neighbours as themselves, and do unto others as they 
would be done by.&nbsp; The Druids declared that it was very 
wicked to believe in any such thing, and cursed all the people 
who did believe it, very heartily.&nbsp; But, when the people 
found that they were none the better for the blessings of the 
Druids, and none the worse for the curses of the Druids, but, 
that the sun shone and the rain fell without consulting the 
Druids at all, they just began to think that the Druids were mere
men, and that it signified very little whether they cursed or 
blessed.&nbsp; After which, the pupils of the Druids fell off 
greatly in numbers, and the Druids took to other trades.</p>
<p>Thus I have come to the end of the Roman time in 
England.&nbsp; It is but little that is known of those five 
hundred years; but some remains of them are still found.&nbsp; 
Often, when labourers are digging up the ground, to make 
foundations for houses or churches, they light on rusty money 
that once belonged to the Romans.&nbsp; Fragments of plates from 
which they ate, of goblets from which they drank, and of pavement
on which they trod, are discovered among the earth that is broken
by the plough, or the dust that is crumbled by the 
gardener&rsquo;s spade.&nbsp; Wells that the Romans sunk, still 
yield water; roads that the Romans made, form part of our 
highways.&nbsp; In some old battle-fields, British spear-heads 
and Roman armour have been found, mingled together in decay, as 
they fell in the thick pressure of the fight.&nbsp; Traces of 
Roman camps overgrown with grass, and of mounds that are the 
burial-places of heaps of Britons, are to be seen in almost all 
parts of the country.&nbsp; Across the bleak moors of 
Northumberland, the wall of <span class="smcap">Severus</span>, 
overrun with moss and weeds, still stretches, a strong ruin; and 
the shepherds and their dogs lie sleeping on it in the summer 
weather.&nbsp; On Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge yet stands: a 
monument of the earlier time when the Roman name was unknown in 
Britain, and when the Druids, with their best magic wands, could 
not have written it in the sands of the wild sea-shore.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;ANCIENT ENGLAND UNDER THE EARLY SAXONS</h2>
<p>The Romans had scarcely gone away from Britain, when the 
Britons began to wish they had never left it.&nbsp; For, the 
Romans being gone, and the Britons being much reduced in numbers 
by their long wars, the Picts and Scots came pouring in, over the
broken and unguarded wall of <span class="smcap">Severus</span>, 
in swarms.&nbsp; They plundered the richest towns, and killed the
people; and came back so often for more booty and more slaughter,
that the unfortunate Britons lived a life of terror.&nbsp; As if 
the Picts and Scots were not bad enough on land, the Saxons 
attacked the islanders by sea; and, as if something more were 
still wanting to make them miserable, they quarrelled bitterly 
among themselves as to what prayers they ought to say, and how 
they ought to say them.&nbsp; The priests, being very angry with 
one another on these questions, cursed one another in the 
heartiest manner; and (uncommonly like the old Druids) cursed all
the people whom they could not persuade.&nbsp; So, altogether, 
the Britons were very badly off, you may believe.</p>
<p>They were in such distress, in short, that they sent a letter 
to Rome entreating help&mdash;which they called the Groans of the
Britons; and in which they said, &lsquo;The barbarians chase us 
into the sea, the sea throws us back upon the barbarians, and we 
have only the hard choice left us of perishing by the sword, or 
perishing by the waves.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, the Romans could not 
help them, even if they were so inclined; for they had enough to 
do to defend themselves against their own enemies, who were then 
very fierce and strong.&nbsp; At last, the Britons, unable to 
bear their hard condition any longer, resolved to make peace with
the Saxons, and to invite the Saxons to come into their country, 
and help them to keep out the Picts and Scots.</p>
<p>It was a British Prince named <span 
class="smcap">Vortigern</span> who took this resolution, and who 
made a treaty of friendship with <span 
class="smcap">Hengist</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Horsa</span>, two Saxon chiefs.&nbsp; Both of these
names, in the old Saxon language, signify Horse; for the Saxons, 
like many other nations in a rough state, were fond of giving men
the names of animals, as Horse, Wolf, Bear, Hound.&nbsp; The 
Indians of North America,&mdash;a very inferior people to the 
Saxons, though&mdash;do the same to this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hengist</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Horsa</span> drove out the Picts and Scots; and 
<span class="smcap">Vortigern</span>, being grateful to them for 
that service, made no opposition to their settling themselves in 
that part of England which is called the Isle of Thanet, or to 
their inviting over more of their countrymen to join them.&nbsp; 
But <span class="smcap">Hengist</span> had a beautiful daughter 
named <span class="smcap">Rowena</span>; and when, at a feast, 
she filled a golden goblet to the brim with wine, and gave it to 
<span class="smcap">Vortigern</span>, saying in a sweet voice, 
&lsquo;Dear King, thy health!&rsquo; the King fell in love with 
her.&nbsp; My opinion is, that the cunning <span 
class="smcap">Hengist</span> meant him to do so, in order that 
the Saxons might have greater influence with him; and that the 
fair <span class="smcap">Rowena</span> came to that feast, golden
goblet and all, on purpose.</p>
<p>At any rate, they were married; and, long afterwards, whenever
the King was angry with the Saxons, or jealous of their 
encroachments, <span class="smcap">Rowena</span> would put her 
beautiful arms round his neck, and softly say, &lsquo;Dear King, 
they are my people!&nbsp; Be favourable to them, as you loved 
that Saxon girl who gave you the golden goblet of wine at the 
feast!&rsquo;&nbsp; And, really, I don&rsquo;t see how the King 
could help himself.</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; We must all die!&nbsp; In the course of years, <span
class="smcap">Vortigern</span> died&mdash;he was dethroned, and 
put in prison, first, I am afraid; and <span 
class="smcap">Rowena</span> died; and generations of Saxons and 
Britons died; and events that happened during a long, long time, 
would have been quite forgotten but for the tales and songs of 
the old Bards, who used to go about from feast to feast, with 
their white beards, recounting the deeds of their 
forefathers.&nbsp; Among the histories of which they sang and 
talked, there was a famous one, concerning the bravery and 
virtues of <span class="smcap">King Arthur</span>, supposed to 
have been a British Prince in those old times.&nbsp; But, whether
such a person really lived, or whether there were several persons
whose histories came to be confused together under that one name,
or whether all about him was invention, no one knows.</p>
<p>I will tell you, shortly, what is most interesting in the 
early Saxon times, as they are described in these songs and 
stories of the Bards.</p>
<p>In, and long after, the days of <span 
class="smcap">Vortigern</span>, fresh bodies of Saxons, under 
various chiefs, came pouring into Britain.&nbsp; One body, 
conquering the Britons in the East, and settling there, called 
their kingdom Essex; another body settled in the West, and called
their kingdom Wessex; the Northfolk, or Norfolk people, 
established themselves in one place; the Southfolk, or Suffolk 
people, established themselves in another; and gradually seven 
kingdoms or states arose in England, which were called the Saxon 
Heptarchy.&nbsp; The poor Britons, falling back before these 
crowds of fighting men whom they had innocently invited over as 
friends, retired into Wales and the adjacent country; into 
Devonshire, and into Cornwall.&nbsp; Those parts of England long 
remained unconquered.&nbsp; And in Cornwall now&mdash;where the 
sea-coast is very gloomy, steep, and rugged&mdash;where, in the 
dark winter-time, ships have often been wrecked close to the 
land, and every soul on board has perished&mdash;where the winds 
and waves howl drearily and split the solid rocks into arches and
caverns&mdash;there are very ancient ruins, which the people call
the ruins of <span class="smcap">King Arthur&rsquo;s</span> 
Castle.</p>
<p>Kent is the most famous of the seven Saxon kingdoms, because 
the Christian religion was preached to the Saxons there (who 
domineered over the Britons too much, to care for what 
<i>they</i> said about their religion, or anything else) by <span
class="smcap">Augustine</span>, a monk from Rome.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">King Ethelbert</span>, of Kent, was soon converted;
and the moment he said he was a Christian, his courtiers all said
<i>they</i> were Christians; after which, ten thousand of his 
subjects said they were Christians too.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Augustine</span> built a little church, close to 
this King&rsquo;s palace, on the ground now occupied by the 
beautiful cathedral of Canterbury.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Sebert</span>, the King&rsquo;s nephew, built on a 
muddy marshy place near London, where there had been a temple to 
Apollo, a church dedicated to Saint Peter, which is now 
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; And, in London itself, on the foundation
of a temple to Diana, he built another little church which has 
risen up, since that old time, to be Saint Paul&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>After the death of <span class="smcap">Ethelbert</span>, <span
class="smcap">Edwin</span>, King of Northumbria, who was such a 
good king that it was said a woman or child might openly carry a 
purse of gold, in his reign, without fear, allowed his child to 
be baptised, and held a great council to consider whether he and 
his people should all be Christians or not.&nbsp; It was decided 
that they should be.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Coifi</span>, the 
chief priest of the old religion, made a great speech on the 
occasion.&nbsp; In this discourse, he told the people that he had
found out the old gods to be impostors.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am quite 
satisfied of it,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at me!&nbsp; I
have been serving them all my life, and they have done nothing 
for me; whereas, if they had been really powerful, they could not
have decently done less, in return for all I have done for them, 
than make my fortune.&nbsp; As they have never made my fortune, I
am quite convinced they are impostors!&rsquo;&nbsp; When this 
singular priest had finished speaking, he hastily armed himself 
with sword and lance, mounted a war-horse, rode at a furious 
gallop in sight of all the people to the temple, and flung his 
lance against it as an insult.&nbsp; From that time, the 
Christian religion spread itself among the Saxons, and became 
their faith.</p>
<p>The next very famous prince was <span 
class="smcap">Egbert</span>.&nbsp; He lived about a hundred and 
fifty years afterwards, and claimed to have a better right to the
throne of Wessex than <span class="smcap">Beortric</span>, 
another Saxon prince who was at the head of that kingdom, and who
married <span class="smcap">Edburga</span>, the daughter of <span
class="smcap">Offa</span>, king of another of the seven 
kingdoms.&nbsp; This <span class="smcap">Queen Edburga</span> was
a handsome murderess, who poisoned people when they offended 
her.&nbsp; One day, she mixed a cup of poison for a certain noble
belonging to the court; but her husband drank of it too, by 
mistake, and died.&nbsp; Upon this, the people revolted, in great
crowds; and running to the palace, and thundering at the gates, 
cried, &lsquo;Down with the wicked queen, who poisons 
men!&rsquo;&nbsp; They drove her out of the country, and 
abolished the title she had disgraced.&nbsp; When years had 
passed away, some travellers came home from Italy, and said that 
in the town of Pavia they had seen a ragged beggar-woman, who had
once been handsome, but was then shrivelled, bent, and yellow, 
wandering about the streets, crying for bread; and that this 
beggar-woman was the poisoning English queen.&nbsp; It was, 
indeed, <span class="smcap">Edburga</span>; and so she died, 
without a shelter for her wretched head.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Egbert</span>, not considering himself 
safe in England, in consequence of his having claimed the crown 
of Wessex (for he thought his rival might take him prisoner and 
put him to death), sought refuge at the court of <span 
class="smcap">Charlemagne</span>, King of France.&nbsp; On the 
death of <span class="smcap">Beortric</span>, so unhappily 
poisoned by mistake, <span class="smcap">Egbert</span> came back 
to Britain; succeeded to the throne of Wessex; conquered some of 
the other monarchs of the seven kingdoms; added their territories
to his own; and, for the first time, called the country over 
which he ruled, <span class="smcap">England</span>.</p>
<p>And now, new enemies arose, who, for a long time, troubled 
England sorely.&nbsp; These were the Northmen, the people of 
Denmark and Norway, whom the English called the Danes.&nbsp; They
were a warlike people, quite at home upon the sea; not 
Christians; very daring and cruel.&nbsp; They came over in ships,
and plundered and burned wheresoever they landed.&nbsp; Once, 
they beat <span class="smcap">Egbert</span> in battle.&nbsp; 
Once, <span class="smcap">Egbert</span> beat them.&nbsp; But, 
they cared no more for being beaten than the English 
themselves.&nbsp; In the four following short reigns, of <span 
class="smcap">Ethelwulf</span>, and his sons, <span 
class="smcap">Ethelbald</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Ethelbert</span>, and <span 
class="smcap">Ethelred</span>, they came back, over and over 
again, burning and plundering, and laying England waste.&nbsp; In
the last-mentioned reign, they seized <span 
class="smcap">Edmund</span>, King of East England, and bound him 
to a tree.&nbsp; Then, they proposed to him that he should change
his religion; but he, being a good Christian, steadily 
refused.&nbsp; Upon that, they beat him, made cowardly jests upon
him, all defenceless as he was, shot arrows at him, and, finally,
struck off his head.&nbsp; It is impossible to say whose head 
they might have struck off next, but for the death of <span 
class="smcap">King Ethelred</span> from a wound he had received 
in fighting against them, and the succession to his throne of the
best and wisest king that ever lived in England.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER THE GOOD SAXON, ALFRED</h2>
<p>Alfred the Great was a young man, three-and-twenty years of 
age, when he became king.&nbsp; Twice in his childhood, he had 
been taken to Rome, where the Saxon nobles were in the habit of 
going on journeys which they supposed to be religious; and, once,
he had stayed for some time in Paris.&nbsp; Learning, however, 
was so little cared for, then, that at twelve years old he had 
not been taught to read; although, of the sons of <span 
class="smcap">King Ethelwulf</span>, he, the youngest, was the 
favourite.&nbsp; But he had&mdash;as most men who grow up to be 
great and good are generally found to have had&mdash;an excellent
mother; and, one day, this lady, whose name was <span 
class="smcap">Osburga</span>, happened, as she was sitting among 
her sons, to read a book of Saxon poetry.&nbsp; The art of 
printing was not known until long and long after that period, and
the book, which was written, was what is called 
&lsquo;illuminated,&rsquo; with beautiful bright letters, richly 
painted.&nbsp; The brothers admiring it very much, their mother 
said, &lsquo;I will give it to that one of you four princes who 
first learns to read.&rsquo;&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Alfred</span> sought out a tutor that very day, 
applied himself to learn with great diligence, and soon won the 
book.&nbsp; He was proud of it, all his life.</p>
<p>This great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine 
battles with the Danes.&nbsp; He made some treaties with them 
too, by which the false Danes swore they would quit the 
country.&nbsp; They pretended to consider that they had taken a 
very solemn oath, in swearing this upon the holy bracelets that 
they wore, and which were always buried with them when they died;
but they cared little for it, for they thought nothing of 
breaking oaths and treaties too, as soon as it suited their 
purpose, and coming back again to fight, plunder, and burn, as 
usual.&nbsp; One fatal winter, in the fourth year of <span 
class="smcap">King Alfred&rsquo;s</span> reign, they spread 
themselves in great numbers over the whole of England; and so 
dispersed and routed the King&rsquo;s soldiers that the King was 
left alone, and was obliged to disguise himself as a common 
peasant, and to take refuge in the cottage of one of his cowherds
who did not know his face.</p>
<p>Here, <span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, while the Danes 
sought him far and near, was left alone one day, by the 
cowherd&rsquo;s wife, to watch some cakes which she put to bake 
upon the hearth.&nbsp; But, being at work upon his bow and 
arrows, with which he hoped to punish the false Danes when a 
brighter time should come, and thinking deeply of his poor 
unhappy subjects whom the Danes chased through the land, his 
noble mind forgot the cakes, and they were burnt.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said the cowherd&rsquo;s wife, who scolded 
him well when she came back, and little thought she was scolding 
the King, &lsquo;you will be ready enough to eat them by-and-by, 
and yet you cannot watch them, idle dog?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At length, the Devonshire men made head against a new host of 
Danes who landed on their coast; killed their chief, and captured
their flag; on which was represented the likeness of a 
Raven&mdash;a very fit bird for a thievish army like that, I 
think.&nbsp; The loss of their standard troubled the Danes 
greatly, for they believed it to be enchanted&mdash;woven by the 
three daughters of one father in a single afternoon&mdash;and 
they had a story among themselves that when they were victorious 
in battle, the Raven stretched his wings and seemed to fly; and 
that when they were defeated, he would droop.&nbsp; He had good 
reason to droop, now, if he could have done anything half so 
sensible; for, <span class="smcap">King Alfred</span> joined the 
Devonshire men; made a camp with them on a piece of firm ground 
in the midst of a bog in Somersetshire; and prepared for a great 
attempt for vengeance on the Danes, and the deliverance of his 
oppressed people.</p>
<p>But, first, as it was important to know how numerous those 
pestilent Danes were, and how they were fortified, <span 
class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, being a good musician, 
disguised himself as a glee-man or minstrel, and went, with his 
harp, to the Danish camp.&nbsp; He played and sang in the very 
tent of <span class="smcap">Guthrum</span> the Danish leader, and
entertained the Danes as they caroused.&nbsp; While he seemed to 
think of nothing but his music, he was watchful of their tents, 
their arms, their discipline, everything that he desired to 
know.&nbsp; And right soon did this great king entertain them to 
a different tune; for, summoning all his true followers to meet 
him at an appointed place, where they received him with joyful 
shouts and tears, as the monarch whom many of them had given up 
for lost or dead, he put himself at their head, marched on the 
Danish camp, defeated the Danes with great slaughter, and 
besieged them for fourteen days to prevent their escape.&nbsp; 
But, being as merciful as he was good and brave, he then, instead
of killing them, proposed peace: on condition that they should 
altogether depart from that Western part of England, and settle 
in the East; and that <span class="smcap">Guthrum</span> should 
become a Christian, in remembrance of the Divine religion which 
now taught his conqueror, the noble <span 
class="smcap">Alfred</span>, to forgive the enemy who had so 
often injured him.&nbsp; This, <span class="smcap">Guthrum</span>
did.&nbsp; At his baptism, <span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>
was his godfather.&nbsp; And <span class="smcap">Guthrum</span> 
was an honourable chief who well deserved that clemency; for, 
ever afterwards he was loyal and faithful to the king.&nbsp; The 
Danes under him were faithful too.&nbsp; They plundered and 
burned no more, but worked like honest men.&nbsp; They ploughed, 
and sowed, and reaped, and led good honest English lives.&nbsp; 
And I hope the children of those Danes played, many a time, with 
Saxon children in the sunny fields; and that Danish young men 
fell in love with Saxon girls, and married them; and that English
travellers, benighted at the doors of Danish cottages, often went
in for shelter until morning; and that Danes and Saxons sat by 
the red fire, friends, talking of <span class="smcap">King Alfred
the Great</span>.</p>
<p>All the Danes were not like these under <span 
class="smcap">Guthrum</span>; for, after some years, more of them
came over, in the old plundering and burning way&mdash;among them
a fierce pirate of the name of <span 
class="smcap">Hastings</span>, who had the boldness to sail up 
the Thames to Gravesend, with eighty ships.&nbsp; For three 
years, there was a war with these Danes; and there was a famine 
in the country, too, and a plague, both upon human creatures and 
beasts.&nbsp; But <span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, whose 
mighty heart never failed him, built large ships nevertheless, 
with which to pursue the pirates on the sea; and he encouraged 
his soldiers, by his brave example, to fight valiantly against 
them on the shore.&nbsp; At last, he drove them all away; and 
then there was repose in England.</p>
<p>As great and good in peace, as he was great and good in war, 
<span class="smcap">King Alfred</span> never rested from his 
labours to improve his people.&nbsp; He loved to talk with clever
men, and with travellers from foreign countries, and to write 
down what they told him, for his people to read.&nbsp; He had 
studied Latin after learning to read English, and now another of 
his labours was, to translate Latin books into the English-Saxon 
tongue, that his people might be interested, and improved by 
their contents.&nbsp; He made just laws, that they might live 
more happily and freely; he turned away all partial judges, that 
no wrong might be done them; he was so careful of their property,
and punished robbers so severely, that it was a common thing to 
say that under the great <span class="smcap">King Alfred</span>, 
garlands of golden chains and jewels might have hung across the 
streets, and no man would have touched one.&nbsp; He founded 
schools; he patiently heard causes himself in his Court of 
Justice; the great desires of his heart were, to do right to all 
his subjects, and to leave England better, wiser, happier in all 
ways, than he found it.&nbsp; His industry in these efforts was 
quite astonishing.&nbsp; Every day he divided into certain 
portions, and in each portion devoted himself to a certain 
pursuit.&nbsp; That he might divide his time exactly, he had wax 
torches or candles made, which were all of the same size, were 
notched across at regular distances, and were always kept 
burning.&nbsp; Thus, as the candles burnt down, he divided the 
day into notches, almost as accurately as we now divide it into 
hours upon the clock.&nbsp; But when the candles were first 
invented, it was found that the wind and draughts of air, blowing
into the palace through the doors and windows, and through the 
chinks in the walls, caused them to gutter and burn 
unequally.&nbsp; To prevent this, the King had them put into 
cases formed of wood and white horn.&nbsp; And these were the 
first lanthorns ever made in England.</p>
<p>All this time, he was afflicted with a terrible unknown 
disease, which caused him violent and frequent pain that nothing 
could relieve.&nbsp; He bore it, as he had borne all the troubles
of his life, like a brave good man, until he was fifty-three 
years old; and then, having reigned thirty years, he died.&nbsp; 
He died in the year nine hundred and one; but, long ago as that 
is, his fame, and the love and gratitude with which his subjects 
regarded him, are freshly remembered to the present hour.</p>
<p>In the next reign, which was the reign of <span 
class="smcap">Edward</span>, surnamed <span class="smcap">The 
Elder</span>, who was chosen in council to succeed, a nephew of 
<span class="smcap">King Alfred</span> troubled the country by 
trying to obtain the throne.&nbsp; The Danes in the East of 
England took part with this usurper (perhaps because they had 
honoured his uncle so much, and honoured him for his 
uncle&rsquo;s sake), and there was hard fighting; but, the King, 
with the assistance of his sister, gained the day, and reigned in
peace for four and twenty years.&nbsp; He gradually extended his 
power over the whole of England, and so the Seven Kingdoms were 
united into one.</p>
<p>When England thus became one kingdom, ruled over by one Saxon 
king, the Saxons had been settled in the country more than four 
hundred and fifty years.&nbsp; Great changes had taken place in 
its customs during that time.&nbsp; The Saxons were still greedy 
eaters and great drinkers, and their feasts were often of a noisy
and drunken kind; but many new comforts and even elegances had 
become known, and were fast increasing.&nbsp; Hangings for the 
walls of rooms, where, in these modern days, we paste up paper, 
are known to have been sometimes made of silk, ornamented with 
birds and flowers in needlework.&nbsp; Tables and chairs were 
curiously carved in different woods; were sometimes decorated 
with gold or silver; sometimes even made of those precious 
metals.&nbsp; Knives and spoons were used at table; golden 
ornaments were worn&mdash;with silk and cloth, and golden tissues
and embroideries; dishes were made of gold and silver, brass and 
bone.&nbsp; There were varieties of drinking-horns, bedsteads, 
musical instruments.&nbsp; A harp was passed round, at a feast, 
like the drinking-bowl, from guest to guest; and each one usually
sang or played when his turn came.&nbsp; The weapons of the 
Saxons were stoutly made, and among them was a terrible iron 
hammer that gave deadly blows, and was long remembered.&nbsp; The
Saxons themselves were a handsome people.&nbsp; The men were 
proud of their long fair hair, parted on the forehead; their 
ample beards, their fresh complexions, and clear eyes.&nbsp; The 
beauty of the Saxon women filled all England with a new delight 
and grace.</p>
<p>I have more to tell of the Saxons yet, but I stop to say this 
now, because under the <span class="smcap">Great Alfred</span>, 
all the best points of the English-Saxon character were first 
encouraged, and in him first shown.&nbsp; It has been the 
greatest character among the nations of the earth.&nbsp; Wherever
the descendants of the Saxon race have gone, have sailed, or 
otherwise made their way, even to the remotest regions of the 
world, they have been patient, persevering, never to be broken in
spirit, never to be turned aside from enterprises on which they 
have resolved.&nbsp; In Europe, Asia, Africa, America, the whole 
world over; in the desert, in the forest, on the sea; scorched by
a burning sun, or frozen by ice that never melts; the Saxon blood
remains unchanged.&nbsp; Wheresoever that race goes, there, law, 
and industry, and safety for life and property, and all the great
results of steady perseverance, are certain to arise.</p>
<p>I pause to think with admiration, of the noble king who, in 
his single person, possessed all the Saxon virtues.&nbsp; Whom 
misfortune could not subdue, whom prosperity could not spoil, 
whose perseverance nothing could shake.&nbsp; Who was hopeful in 
defeat, and generous in success.&nbsp; Who loved justice, 
freedom, truth, and knowledge.&nbsp; Who, in his care to instruct
his people, probably did more to preserve the beautiful old Saxon
language, than I can imagine.&nbsp; Without whom, the English 
tongue in which I tell this story might have wanted half its 
meaning.&nbsp; As it is said that his spirit still inspires some 
of our best English laws, so, let you and I pray that it may 
animate our English hearts, at least to this&mdash;to resolve, 
when we see any of our fellow-creatures left in ignorance, that 
we will do our best, while life is in us, to have them taught; 
and to tell those rulers whose duty it is to teach them, and who 
neglect their duty, that they have profited very little by all 
the years that have rolled away since the year nine hundred and 
one, and that they are far behind the bright example of <span 
class="smcap">King Alfred the Great</span>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER ATHELSTAN AND THE SIX 
BOY-KINGS</h2>
<p>Athelstan, the son of Edward the Elder, succeeded that 
king.&nbsp; He reigned only fifteen years; but he remembered the 
glory of his grandfather, the great Alfred, and governed England 
well.&nbsp; He reduced the turbulent people of Wales, and obliged
them to pay him a tribute in money, and in cattle, and to send 
him their best hawks and hounds.&nbsp; He was victorious over the
Cornish men, who were not yet quite under the Saxon 
government.&nbsp; He restored such of the old laws as were good, 
and had fallen into disuse; made some wise new laws, and took 
care of the poor and weak.&nbsp; A strong alliance, made against 
him by <span class="smcap">Anlaf</span> a Danish prince, <span 
class="smcap">Constantine</span> King of the Scots, and the 
people of North Wales, he broke and defeated in one great battle,
long famous for the vast numbers slain in it.&nbsp; After that, 
he had a quiet reign; the lords and ladies about him had leisure 
to become polite and agreeable; and foreign princes were glad (as
they have sometimes been since) to come to England on visits to 
the English court.</p>
<p>When Athelstan died, at forty-seven years old, his brother 
<span class="smcap">Edmund</span>, who was only eighteen, became 
king.&nbsp; He was the first of six boy-kings, as you will 
presently know.</p>
<p>They called him the Magnificent, because he showed a taste for
improvement and refinement.&nbsp; But he was beset by the Danes, 
and had a short and troubled reign, which came to a troubled 
end.&nbsp; One night, when he was feasting in his hall, and had 
eaten much and drunk deep, he saw, among the company, a noted 
robber named <span class="smcap">Leof</span>, who had been 
banished from England.&nbsp; Made very angry by the boldness of 
this man, the King turned to his cup-bearer, and said, 
&lsquo;There is a robber sitting at the table yonder, who, for 
his crimes, is an outlaw in the land&mdash;a hunted wolf, whose 
life any man may take, at any time.&nbsp; Command that robber to 
depart!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I will not depart!&rsquo; said 
Leof.&nbsp; &lsquo;No?&rsquo; cried the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, by
the Lord!&rsquo; said Leof.&nbsp; Upon that the King rose from 
his seat, and, making passionately at the robber, and seizing him
by his long hair, tried to throw him down.&nbsp; But the robber 
had a dagger underneath his cloak, and, in the scuffle, stabbed 
the King to death.&nbsp; That done, he set his back against the 
wall, and fought so desperately, that although he was soon cut to
pieces by the King&rsquo;s armed men, and the wall and pavement 
were splashed with his blood, yet it was not before he had killed
and wounded many of them.&nbsp; You may imagine what rough lives 
the kings of those times led, when one of them could struggle, 
half drunk, with a public robber in his own dining-hall, and be 
stabbed in presence of the company who ate and drank with 
him.</p>
<p>Then succeeded the boy-king <span class="smcap">Edred</span>, 
who was weak and sickly in body, but of a strong mind.&nbsp; And 
his armies fought the Northmen, the Danes, and Norwegians, or the
Sea-Kings, as they were called, and beat them for the time.&nbsp;
And, in nine years, Edred died, and passed away.</p>
<p>Then came the boy-king <span class="smcap">Edwy</span>, 
fifteen years of age; but the real king, who had the real power, 
was a monk named <span class="smcap">Dunstan</span>&mdash;a 
clever priest, a little mad, and not a little proud and 
cruel.</p>
<p>Dunstan was then Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, whither the body 
of King Edmund the Magnificent was carried, to be buried.&nbsp; 
While yet a boy, he had got out of his bed one night (being then 
in a fever), and walked about Glastonbury Church when it was 
under repair; and, because he did not tumble off some scaffolds 
that were there, and break his neck, it was reported that he had 
been shown over the building by an angel.&nbsp; He had also made 
a harp that was said to play of itself&mdash;which it very likely
did, as &AElig;olian Harps, which are played by the wind, and are
understood now, always do.&nbsp; For these wonders he had been 
once denounced by his enemies, who were jealous of his favour 
with the late King Athelstan, as a magician; and he had been 
waylaid, bound hand and foot, and thrown into a marsh.&nbsp; But 
he got out again, somehow, to cause a great deal of trouble 
yet.</p>
<p>The priests of those days were, generally, the only 
scholars.&nbsp; They were learned in many things.&nbsp; Having to
make their own convents and monasteries on uncultivated grounds 
that were granted to them by the Crown, it was necessary that 
they should be good farmers and good gardeners, or their lands 
would have been too poor to support them.&nbsp; For the 
decoration of the chapels where they prayed, and for the comfort 
of the refectories where they ate and drank, it was necessary 
that there should be good carpenters, good smiths, good painters,
among them.&nbsp; For their greater safety in sickness and 
accident, living alone by themselves in solitary places, it was 
necessary that they should study the virtues of plants and herbs,
and should know how to dress cuts, burns, scalds, and bruises, 
and how to set broken limbs.&nbsp; Accordingly, they taught 
themselves, and one another, a great variety of useful arts; and 
became skilful in agriculture, medicine, surgery, and 
handicraft.&nbsp; And when they wanted the aid of any little 
piece of machinery, which would be simple enough now, but was 
marvellous then, to impose a trick upon the poor peasants, they 
knew very well how to make it; and <i>did</i> make it many a time
and often, I have no doubt.</p>
<p>Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was one of the most 
sagacious of these monks.&nbsp; He was an ingenious smith, and 
worked at a forge in a little cell.&nbsp; This cell was made too 
short to admit of his lying at full length when he went to 
sleep&mdash;as if <i>that</i> did any good to anybody!&mdash;and 
he used to tell the most extraordinary lies about demons and 
spirits, who, he said, came there to persecute him.&nbsp; For 
instance, he related that one day when he was at work, the devil 
looked in at the little window, and tried to tempt him to lead a 
life of idle pleasure; whereupon, having his pincers in the fire,
red hot, he seized the devil by the nose, and put him to such 
pain, that his bellowings were heard for miles and miles.&nbsp; 
Some people are inclined to think this nonsense a part of 
Dunstan&rsquo;s madness (for his head never quite recovered the 
fever), but I think not.&nbsp; I observe that it induced the 
ignorant people to consider him a holy man, and that it made him 
very powerful.&nbsp; Which was exactly what he always wanted.</p>
<p>On the day of the coronation of the handsome boy-king Edwy, it
was remarked by <span class="smcap">Odo</span>, Archbishop of 
Canterbury (who was a Dane by birth), that the King quietly left 
the coronation feast, while all the company were there.&nbsp; 
Odo, much displeased, sent his friend Dunstan to seek him.&nbsp; 
Dunstan finding him in the company of his beautiful young wife 
<span class="smcap">Elgiva</span>, and her mother <span 
class="smcap">Ethelgiva</span>, a good and virtuous lady, not 
only grossly abused them, but dragged the young King back into 
the feasting-hall by force.&nbsp; Some, again, think Dunstan did 
this because the young King&rsquo;s fair wife was his own cousin,
and the monks objected to people marrying their own cousins; but 
I believe he did it, because he was an imperious, audacious, 
ill-conditioned priest, who, having loved a young lady himself 
before he became a sour monk, hated all love now, and everything 
belonging to it.</p>
<p>The young King was quite old enough to feel this insult.&nbsp;
Dunstan had been Treasurer in the last reign, and he soon charged
Dunstan with having taken some of the last king&rsquo;s 
money.&nbsp; The Glastonbury Abbot fled to Belgium (very narrowly
escaping some pursuers who were sent to put out his eyes, as you 
will wish they had, when you read what follows), and his abbey 
was given to priests who were married; whom he always, both 
before and afterwards, opposed.&nbsp; But he quickly conspired 
with his friend, Odo the Dane, to set up the King&rsquo;s young 
brother, <span class="smcap">Edgar</span>, as his rival for the 
throne; and, not content with this revenge, he caused the 
beautiful queen Elgiva, though a lovely girl of only seventeen or
eighteen, to be stolen from one of the Royal Palaces, branded in 
the cheek with a red-hot iron, and sold into slavery in 
Ireland.&nbsp; But the Irish people pitied and befriended her; 
and they said, &lsquo;Let us restore the girl-queen to the 
boy-king, and make the young lovers happy!&rsquo; and they cured 
her of her cruel wound, and sent her home as beautiful as 
before.&nbsp; But the villain Dunstan, and that other villain, 
Odo, caused her to be waylaid at Gloucester as she was joyfully 
hurrying to join her husband, and to be hacked and hewn with 
swords, and to be barbarously maimed and lamed, and left to 
die.&nbsp; When Edwy the Fair (his people called him so, because 
he was so young and handsome) heard of her dreadful fate, he died
of a broken heart; and so the pitiful story of the poor young 
wife and husband ends!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Better to be two cottagers
in these better times, than king and queen of England in those 
bad days, though never so fair!</p>
<p>Then came the boy-king, <span class="smcap">Edgar</span>, 
called the Peaceful, fifteen years old.&nbsp; Dunstan, being 
still the real king, drove all married priests out of the 
monasteries and abbeys, and replaced them by solitary monks like 
himself, of the rigid order called the Benedictines.&nbsp; He 
made himself Archbishop of Canterbury, for his greater glory; and
exercised such power over the neighbouring British princes, and 
so collected them about the King, that once, when the King held 
his court at Chester, and went on the river Dee to visit the 
monastery of St. John, the eight oars of his boat were pulled (as
the people used to delight in relating in stories and songs) by 
eight crowned kings, and steered by the King of England.&nbsp; As
Edgar was very obedient to Dunstan and the monks, they took great
pains to represent him as the best of kings.&nbsp; But he was 
really profligate, debauched, and vicious.&nbsp; He once forcibly
carried off a young lady from the convent at Wilton; and Dunstan,
pretending to be very much shocked, condemned him not to wear his
crown upon his head for seven years&mdash;no great punishment, I 
dare say, as it can hardly have been a more comfortable ornament 
to wear, than a stewpan without a handle.&nbsp; His marriage with
his second wife, <span class="smcap">Elfrida</span>, is one of 
the worst events of his reign.&nbsp; Hearing of the beauty of 
this lady, he despatched his favourite courtier, <span 
class="smcap">Athelwold</span>, to her father&rsquo;s castle in 
Devonshire, to see if she were really as charming as fame 
reported.&nbsp; Now, she was so exceedingly beautiful that 
Athelwold fell in love with her himself, and married her; but he 
told the King that she was only rich&mdash;not handsome.&nbsp; 
The King, suspecting the truth when they came home, resolved to 
pay the newly-married couple a visit; and, suddenly, told 
Athelwold to prepare for his immediate coming.&nbsp; Athelwold, 
terrified, confessed to his young wife what he had said and done,
and implored her to disguise her beauty by some ugly dress or 
silly manner, that he might be safe from the King&rsquo;s 
anger.&nbsp; She promised that she would; but she was a proud 
woman, who would far rather have been a queen than the wife of a 
courtier.&nbsp; She dressed herself in her best dress, and 
adorned herself with her richest jewels; and when the King came, 
presently, he discovered the cheat.&nbsp; So, he caused his false
friend, Athelwold, to be murdered in a wood, and married his 
widow, this bad Elfrida.&nbsp; Six or seven years afterwards, he 
died; and was buried, as if he had been all that the monks said 
he was, in the abbey of Glastonbury, which he&mdash;or Dunstan 
for him&mdash;had much enriched.</p>
<p>England, in one part of this reign, was so troubled by wolves,
which, driven out of the open country, hid themselves in the 
mountains of Wales when they were not attacking travellers and 
animals, that the tribute payable by the Welsh people was 
forgiven them, on condition of their producing, every year, three
hundred wolves&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; And the Welshmen were so sharp
upon the wolves, to save their money, that in four years there 
was not a wolf left.</p>
<p>Then came the boy-king, <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, 
called the Martyr, from the manner of his death.&nbsp; Elfrida 
had a son, named <span class="smcap">Ethelred</span>, for whom 
she claimed the throne; but Dunstan did not choose to favour him,
and he made Edward king.&nbsp; The boy was hunting, one day, down
in Dorsetshire, when he rode near to Corfe Castle, where Elfrida 
and Ethelred lived.&nbsp; Wishing to see them kindly, he rode 
away from his attendants and galloped to the castle gate, where 
he arrived at twilight, and blew his hunting-horn.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You are welcome, dear King,&rsquo; said Elfrida, coming 
out, with her brightest smiles.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray you dismount 
and enter.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not so, dear madam,&rsquo; said 
the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;My company will miss me, and fear that I 
have met with some harm.&nbsp; Please you to give me a cup of 
wine, that I may drink here, in the saddle, to you and to my 
little brother, and so ride away with the good speed I have made 
in riding here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Elfrida, going in to bring the wine,
whispered an armed servant, one of her attendants, who stole out 
of the darkening gateway, and crept round behind the King&rsquo;s
horse.&nbsp; As the King raised the cup to his lips, saying, 
&lsquo;Health!&rsquo; to the wicked woman who was smiling on him,
and to his innocent brother whose hand she held in hers, and who 
was only ten years old, this armed man made a spring and stabbed 
him in the back.&nbsp; He dropped the cup and spurred his horse 
away; but, soon fainting with loss of blood, dropped from the 
saddle, and, in his fall, entangled one of his feet in the 
stirrup.&nbsp; The frightened horse dashed on; trailing his 
rider&rsquo;s curls upon the ground; dragging his smooth young 
face through ruts, and stones, and briers, and fallen leaves, and
mud; until the hunters, tracking the animal&rsquo;s course by the
King&rsquo;s blood, caught his bridle, and released the 
disfigured body.</p>
<p>Then came the sixth and last of the boy-kings, <span 
class="smcap">Ethelred</span>, whom Elfrida, when he cried out at
the sight of his murdered brother riding away from the castle 
gate, unmercifully beat with a torch which she snatched from one 
of the attendants.&nbsp; The people so disliked this boy, on 
account of his cruel mother and the murder she had done to 
promote him, that Dunstan would not have had him for king, but 
would have made <span class="smcap">Edgitha</span>, the daughter 
of the dead King Edgar, and of the lady whom he stole out of the 
convent at Wilton, Queen of England, if she would have 
consented.&nbsp; But she knew the stories of the youthful kings 
too well, and would not be persuaded from the convent where she 
lived in peace; so, Dunstan put Ethelred on the throne, having no
one else to put there, and gave him the nickname of <span 
class="smcap">The Unready</span>&mdash;knowing that he wanted 
resolution and firmness.</p>
<p>At first, Elfrida possessed great influence over the young 
King, but, as he grew older and came of age, her influence 
declined.&nbsp; The infamous woman, not having it in her power to
do any more evil, then retired from court, and, according, to the
fashion of the time, built churches and monasteries, to expiate 
her guilt.&nbsp; As if a church, with a steeple reaching to the 
very stars, would have been any sign of true repentance for the 
blood of the poor boy, whose murdered form was trailed at his 
horse&rsquo;s heels!&nbsp; As if she could have buried her 
wickedness beneath the senseless stones of the whole world, piled
up one upon another, for the monks to live in!</p>
<p>About the ninth or tenth year of this reign, Dunstan 
died.&nbsp; He was growing old then, but was as stern and artful 
as ever.&nbsp; Two circumstances that happened in connexion with 
him, in this reign of Ethelred, made a great noise.&nbsp; Once, 
he was present at a meeting of the Church, when the question was 
discussed whether priests should have permission to marry; and, 
as he sat with his head hung down, apparently thinking about it, 
a voice seemed to come out of a crucifix in the room, and warn 
the meeting to be of his opinion.&nbsp; This was some juggling of
Dunstan&rsquo;s, and was probably his own voice disguised.&nbsp; 
But he played off a worse juggle than that, soon afterwards; for,
another meeting being held on the same subject, and he and his 
supporters being seated on one side of a great room, and their 
opponents on the other, he rose and said, &lsquo;To Christ 
himself, as judge, do I commit this cause!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Immediately on these words being spoken, the floor where the 
opposite party sat gave way, and some were killed and many 
wounded.&nbsp; You may be pretty sure that it had been weakened 
under Dunstan&rsquo;s direction, and that it fell at 
Dunstan&rsquo;s signal.&nbsp; <i>His</i> part of the floor did 
not go down.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; He was too good a workman for 
that.</p>
<p>When he died, the monks settled that he was a Saint, and 
called him Saint Dunstan ever afterwards.&nbsp; They might just 
as well have settled that he was a coach-horse, and could just as
easily have called him one.</p>
<p>Ethelred the Unready was glad enough, I dare say, to be rid of
this holy saint; but, left to himself, he was a poor weak king, 
and his reign was a reign of defeat and shame.&nbsp; The restless
Danes, led by <span class="smcap">Sweyn</span>, a son of the King
of Denmark who had quarrelled with his father and had been 
banished from home, again came into England, and, year after 
year, attacked and despoiled large towns.&nbsp; To coax these 
sea-kings away, the weak Ethelred paid them money; but, the more 
money he paid, the more money the Danes wanted.&nbsp; At first, 
he gave them ten thousand pounds; on their next invasion, sixteen
thousand pounds; on their next invasion, four and twenty thousand
pounds: to pay which large sums, the unfortunate English people 
were heavily taxed.&nbsp; But, as the Danes still came back and 
wanted more, he thought it would be a good plan to marry into 
some powerful foreign family that would help him with 
soldiers.&nbsp; So, in the year one thousand and two, he courted 
and married Emma, the sister of Richard Duke of Normandy; a lady 
who was called the Flower of Normandy.</p>
<p>And now, a terrible deed was done in England, the like of 
which was never done on English ground before or since.&nbsp; On 
the thirteenth of November, in pursuance of secret instructions 
sent by the King over the whole country, the inhabitants of every
town and city armed, and murdered all the Danes who were their 
neighbours.</p>
<p>Young and old, babies and soldiers, men and women, every Dane 
was killed.&nbsp; No doubt there were among them many ferocious 
men who had done the English great wrong, and whose pride and 
insolence, in swaggering in the houses of the English and 
insulting their wives and daughters, had become unbearable; but 
no doubt there were also among them many peaceful Christian Danes
who had married English women and become like English men.&nbsp; 
They were all slain, even to <span class="smcap">Gunhilda</span>,
the sister of the King of Denmark, married to an English lord; 
who was first obliged to see the murder of her husband and her 
child, and then was killed herself.</p>
<p>When the King of the sea-kings heard of this deed of blood, he
swore that he would have a great revenge.&nbsp; He raised an 
army, and a mightier fleet of ships than ever yet had sailed to 
England; and in all his army there was not a slave or an old man,
but every soldier was a free man, and the son of a free man, and 
in the prime of life, and sworn to be revenged upon the English 
nation, for the massacre of that dread thirteenth of November, 
when his countrymen and countrywomen, and the little children 
whom they loved, were killed with fire and sword.&nbsp; And so, 
the sea-kings came to England in many great ships, each bearing 
the flag of its own commander.&nbsp; Golden eagles, ravens, 
dragons, dolphins, beasts of prey, threatened England from the 
prows of those ships, as they came onward through the water; and 
were reflected in the shining shields that hung upon their 
sides.&nbsp; The ship that bore the standard of the King of the 
sea-kings was carved and painted like a mighty serpent; and the 
King in his anger prayed that the Gods in whom he trusted might 
all desert him, if his serpent did not strike its fangs into 
England&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>And indeed it did.&nbsp; For, the great army landing from the 
great fleet, near Exeter, went forward, laying England waste, and
striking their lances in the earth as they advanced, or throwing 
them into rivers, in token of their making all the island 
theirs.&nbsp; In remembrance of the black November night when the
Danes were murdered, wheresoever the invaders came, they made the
Saxons prepare and spread for them great feasts; and when they 
had eaten those feasts, and had drunk a curse to England with 
wild rejoicings, they drew their swords, and killed their Saxon 
entertainers, and marched on.&nbsp; For six long years they 
carried on this war: burning the crops, farmhouses, barns, mills,
granaries; killing the labourers in the fields; preventing the 
seed from being sown in the ground; causing famine and 
starvation; leaving only heaps of ruin and smoking ashes, where 
they had found rich towns.&nbsp; To crown this misery, English 
officers and men deserted, and even the favourites of Ethelred 
the Unready, becoming traitors, seized many of the English ships,
turned pirates against their own country, and aided by a storm 
occasioned the loss of nearly the whole English navy.</p>
<p>There was but one man of note, at this miserable pass, who was
true to his country and the feeble King.&nbsp; He was a priest, 
and a brave one.&nbsp; For twenty days, the Archbishop of 
Canterbury defended that city against its Danish besiegers; and 
when a traitor in the town threw the gates open and admitted 
them, he said, in chains, &lsquo;I will not buy my life with 
money that must be extorted from the suffering people.&nbsp; Do 
with me what you please!&rsquo;&nbsp; Again and again, he 
steadily refused to purchase his release with gold wrung from the
poor.</p>
<p>At last, the Danes being tired of this, and being assembled at
a drunken merry-making, had him brought into the 
feasting-hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, bishop,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;we want 
gold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked round on the crowd of angry faces; from the shaggy 
beards close to him, to the shaggy beards against the walls, 
where men were mounted on tables and forms to see him over the 
heads of others: and he knew that his time was come.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no gold,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get it, bishop!&rsquo; they all thundered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That, I have often told you I will not,&rsquo; said 
he.</p>
<p>They gathered closer round him, threatening, but he stood 
unmoved.&nbsp; Then, one man struck him; then, another; then a 
cursing soldier picked up from a heap in a corner of the hall, 
where fragments had been rudely thrown at dinner, a great 
ox-bone, and cast it at his face, from which the blood came 
spurting forth; then, others ran to the same heap, and knocked 
him down with other bones, and bruised and battered him; until 
one soldier whom he had baptised (willing, as I hope for the sake
of that soldier&rsquo;s soul, to shorten the sufferings of the 
good man) struck him dead with his battle-axe.</p>
<p>If Ethelred had had the heart to emulate the courage of this 
noble archbishop, he might have done something yet.&nbsp; But he 
paid the Danes forty-eight thousand pounds, instead, and gained 
so little by the cowardly act, that Sweyn soon afterwards came 
over to subdue all England.&nbsp; So broken was the attachment of
the English people, by this time, to their incapable King and 
their forlorn country which could not protect them, that they 
welcomed Sweyn on all sides, as a deliverer.&nbsp; London 
faithfully stood out, as long as the King was within its walls; 
but, when he sneaked away, it also welcomed the Dane.&nbsp; Then,
all was over; and the King took refuge abroad with the Duke of 
Normandy, who had already given shelter to the King&rsquo;s wife,
once the Flower of that country, and to her children.</p>
<p>Still, the English people, in spite of their sad sufferings, 
could not quite forget the great King Alfred and the Saxon 
race.&nbsp; When Sweyn died suddenly, in little more than a month
after he had been proclaimed King of England, they generously 
sent to Ethelred, to say that they would have him for their King 
again, &lsquo;if he would only govern them better than he had 
governed them before.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Unready, instead of coming
himself, sent Edward, one of his sons, to make promises for 
him.&nbsp; At last, he followed, and the English declared him 
King.&nbsp; The Danes declared <span class="smcap">Canute</span>,
the son of Sweyn, King.&nbsp; Thus, direful war began again, and 
lasted for three years, when the Unready died.&nbsp; And I know 
of nothing better that he did, in all his reign of eight and 
thirty years.</p>
<p>Was Canute to be King now?&nbsp; Not over the Saxons, they 
said; they must have <span class="smcap">Edmund</span>, one of 
the sons of the Unready, who was surnamed <span 
class="smcap">Ironside</span>, because of his strength and 
stature.&nbsp; Edmund and Canute thereupon fell to, and fought 
five battles&mdash;O unhappy England, what a fighting-ground it 
was!&mdash;and then Ironside, who was a big man, proposed to 
Canute, who was a little man, that they two should fight it out 
in single combat.&nbsp; If Canute had been the big man, he would 
probably have said yes, but, being the little man, he decidedly 
said no.&nbsp; However, he declared that he was willing to divide
the kingdom&mdash;to take all that lay north of Watling Street, 
as the old Roman military road from Dover to Chester was called, 
and to give Ironside all that lay south of it.&nbsp; Most men 
being weary of so much bloodshed, this was done.&nbsp; But Canute
soon became sole King of England; for Ironside died suddenly 
within two months.&nbsp; Some think that he was killed, and 
killed by Canute&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; No one knows.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER CANUTE THE DANE</h2>
<p>Canute reigned eighteen years.&nbsp; He was a merciless King 
at first.&nbsp; After he had clasped the hands of the Saxon 
chiefs, in token of the sincerity with which he swore to be just 
and good to them in return for their acknowledging him, he 
denounced and slew many of them, as well as many relations of the
late King.&nbsp; &lsquo;He who brings me the head of one of my 
enemies,&rsquo; he used to say, &lsquo;shall be dearer to me than
a brother.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he was so severe in hunting down his 
enemies, that he must have got together a pretty large family of 
these dear brothers.&nbsp; He was strongly inclined to kill <span
class="smcap">Edmund</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Edward</span>, two children, sons of poor Ironside;
but, being afraid to do so in England, he sent them over to the 
King of Sweden, with a request that the King would be so good as 
&lsquo;dispose of them.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the King of Sweden had 
been like many, many other men of that day, he would have had 
their innocent throats cut; but he was a kind man, and brought 
them up tenderly.</p>
<p>Normandy ran much in Canute&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; In Normandy 
were the two children of the late king&mdash;<span 
class="smcap">Edward</span> and <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>
by name; and their uncle the Duke might one day claim the crown 
for them.&nbsp; But the Duke showed so little inclination to do 
so now, that he proposed to Canute to marry his sister, the widow
of The Unready; who, being but a showy flower, and caring for 
nothing so much as becoming a queen again, left her children and 
was wedded to him.</p>
<p>Successful and triumphant, assisted by the valour of the 
English in his foreign wars, and with little strife to trouble 
him at home, Canute had a prosperous reign, and made many 
improvements.&nbsp; He was a poet and a musician.&nbsp; He grew 
sorry, as he grew older, for the blood he had shed at first; and 
went to Rome in a Pilgrim&rsquo;s dress, by way of washing it 
out.&nbsp; He gave a great deal of money to foreigners on his 
journey; but he took it from the English before he started.&nbsp;
On the whole, however, he certainly became a far better man when 
he had no opposition to contend with, and was as great a King as 
England had known for some time.</p>
<p>The old writers of history relate how that Canute was one day 
disgusted with his courtiers for their flattery, and how he 
caused his chair to be set on the sea-shore, and feigned to 
command the tide as it came up not to wet the edge of his robe, 
for the land was his; how the tide came up, of course, without 
regarding him; and how he then turned to his flatterers, and 
rebuked them, saying, what was the might of any earthly king, to 
the might of the Creator, who could say unto the sea, &lsquo;Thus
far shalt thou go, and no farther!&rsquo;&nbsp; We may learn from
this, I think, that a little sense will go a long way in a king; 
and that courtiers are not easily cured of flattery, nor kings of
a liking for it.&nbsp; If the courtiers of Canute had not known, 
long before, that the King was fond of flattery, they would have 
known better than to offer it in such large doses.&nbsp; And if 
they had not known that he was vain of this speech (anything but 
a wonderful speech it seems to me, if a good child had made it), 
they would not have been at such great pains to repeat it.&nbsp; 
I fancy I see them all on the sea-shore together; the 
King&rsquo;s chair sinking in the sand; the King in a mighty good
humour with his own wisdom; and the courtiers pretending to be 
quite stunned by it!</p>
<p>It is not the sea alone that is bidden to go &lsquo;thus far, 
and no farther.&rsquo;&nbsp; The great command goes forth to all 
the kings upon the earth, and went to Canute in the year one 
thousand and thirty-five, and stretched him dead upon his 
bed.&nbsp; Beside it, stood his Norman wife.&nbsp; Perhaps, as 
the King looked his last upon her, he, who had so often thought 
distrustfully of Normandy, long ago, thought once more of the two
exiled Princes in their uncle&rsquo;s court, and of the little 
favour they could feel for either Danes or Saxons, and of a 
rising cloud in Normandy that slowly moved towards England.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD HAREFOOT, HARDICANUTE, 
AND EDWARD THE CONFESSOR</h2>
<p>Canute left three sons, by name <span 
class="smcap">Sweyn</span>, <span class="smcap">Harold</span>, 
and <span class="smcap">Hardicanute</span>; but his Queen, Emma, 
once the Flower of Normandy, was the mother of only 
Hardicanute.&nbsp; Canute had wished his dominions to be divided 
between the three, and had wished Harold to have England; but the
Saxon people in the South of England, headed by a nobleman with 
great possessions, called the powerful <span class="smcap">Earl 
Godwin</span> (who is said to have been originally a poor 
cow-boy), opposed this, and desired to have, instead, either 
Hardicanute, or one of the two exiled Princes who were over in 
Normandy.&nbsp; It seemed so certain that there would be more 
bloodshed to settle this dispute, that many people left their 
homes, and took refuge in the woods and swamps.&nbsp; Happily, 
however, it was agreed to refer the whole question to a great 
meeting at Oxford, which decided that Harold should have all the 
country north of the Thames, with London for his capital city, 
and that Hardicanute should have all the south.&nbsp; The quarrel
was so arranged; and, as Hardicanute was in Denmark troubling 
himself very little about anything but eating and getting drunk, 
his mother and Earl Godwin governed the south for him.</p>
<p>They had hardly begun to do so, and the trembling people who 
had hidden themselves were scarcely at home again, when Edward, 
the elder of the two exiled Princes, came over from Normandy with
a few followers, to claim the English Crown.&nbsp; His mother 
Emma, however, who only cared for her last son Hardicanute, 
instead of assisting him, as he expected, opposed him so strongly
with all her influence that he was very soon glad to get safely 
back.&nbsp; His brother Alfred was not so fortunate.&nbsp; 
Believing in an affectionate letter, written some time afterwards
to him and his brother, in his mother&rsquo;s name (but whether 
really with or without his mother&rsquo;s knowledge is now 
uncertain), he allowed himself to be tempted over to England, 
with a good force of soldiers, and landing on the Kentish coast, 
and being met and welcomed by Earl Godwin, proceeded into Surrey,
as far as the town of Guildford.&nbsp; Here, he and his men 
halted in the evening to rest, having still the Earl in their 
company; who had ordered lodgings and good cheer for them.&nbsp; 
But, in the dead of the night, when they were off their guard, 
being divided into small parties sleeping soundly after a long 
march and a plentiful supper in different houses, they were set 
upon by the King&rsquo;s troops, and taken prisoners.&nbsp; Next 
morning they were drawn out in a line, to the number of six 
hundred men, and were barbarously tortured and killed; with the 
exception of every tenth man, who was sold into slavery.&nbsp; As
to the wretched Prince Alfred, he was stripped naked, tied to a 
horse and sent away into the Isle of Ely, where his eyes were 
torn out of his head, and where in a few days he miserably 
died.&nbsp; I am not sure that the Earl had wilfully entrapped 
him, but I suspect it strongly.</p>
<p>Harold was now King all over England, though it is doubtful 
whether the Archbishop of Canterbury (the greater part of the 
priests were Saxons, and not friendly to the Danes) ever 
consented to crown him.&nbsp; Crowned or uncrowned, with the 
Archbishop&rsquo;s leave or without it, he was King for four 
years: after which short reign he died, and was buried; having 
never done much in life but go a hunting.&nbsp; He was such a 
fast runner at this, his favourite sport, that the people called 
him Harold Harefoot.</p>
<p>Hardicanute was then at Bruges, in Flanders, plotting, with 
his mother (who had gone over there after the cruel murder of 
Prince Alfred), for the invasion of England.&nbsp; The Danes and 
Saxons, finding themselves without a King, and dreading new 
disputes, made common cause, and joined in inviting him to occupy
the Throne.&nbsp; He consented, and soon troubled them enough; 
for he brought over numbers of Danes, and taxed the people so 
insupportably to enrich those greedy favourites that there were 
many insurrections, especially one at Worcester, where the 
citizens rose and killed his tax-collectors; in revenge for which
he burned their city.&nbsp; He was a brutal King, whose first 
public act was to order the dead body of poor Harold Harefoot to 
be dug up, beheaded, and thrown into the river.&nbsp; His end was
worthy of such a beginning.&nbsp; He fell down drunk, with a 
goblet of wine in his hand, at a wedding-feast at Lambeth, given 
in honour of the marriage of his standard-bearer, a Dane named 
<span class="smcap">Towed the Proud</span>.&nbsp; And he never 
spoke again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span>, afterwards called by the 
monks <span class="smcap">The Confessor</span>, succeeded; and 
his first act was to oblige his mother Emma, who had favoured him
so little, to retire into the country; where she died some ten 
years afterwards.&nbsp; He was the exiled prince whose brother 
Alfred had been so foully killed.&nbsp; He had been invited over 
from Normandy by Hardicanute, in the course of his short reign of
two years, and had been handsomely treated at court.&nbsp; His 
cause was now favoured by the powerful Earl Godwin, and he was 
soon made King.&nbsp; This Earl had been suspected by the people,
ever since Prince Alfred&rsquo;s cruel death; he had even been 
tried in the last reign for the Prince&rsquo;s murder, but had 
been pronounced not guilty; chiefly, as it was supposed, because 
of a present he had made to the swinish King, of a gilded ship 
with a figure-head of solid gold, and a crew of eighty splendidly
armed men.&nbsp; It was his interest to help the new King with 
his power, if the new King would help him against the popular 
distrust and hatred.&nbsp; So they made a bargain.&nbsp; Edward 
the Confessor got the Throne.&nbsp; The Earl got more power and 
more land, and his daughter Editha was made queen; for it was a 
part of their compact that the King should take her for his 
wife.</p>
<p>But, although she was a gentle lady, in all things worthy to 
be beloved&mdash;good, beautiful, sensible, and kind&mdash;the 
King from the first neglected her.&nbsp; Her father and her six 
proud brothers, resenting this cold treatment, harassed the King 
greatly by exerting all their power to make him unpopular.&nbsp; 
Having lived so long in Normandy, he preferred the Normans to the
English.&nbsp; He made a Norman Archbishop, and Norman Bishops; 
his great officers and favourites were all Normans; he introduced
the Norman fashions and the Norman language; in imitation of the 
state custom of Normandy, he attached a great seal to his state 
documents, instead of merely marking them, as the Saxon Kings had
done, with the sign of the cross&mdash;just as poor people who 
have never been taught to write, now make the same mark for their
names.&nbsp; All this, the powerful Earl Godwin and his six proud
sons represented to the people as disfavour shown towards the 
English; and thus they daily increased their own power, and daily
diminished the power of the King.</p>
<p>They were greatly helped by an event that occurred when he had
reigned eight years.&nbsp; Eustace, Earl of Bologne, who had 
married the King&rsquo;s sister, came to England on a 
visit.&nbsp; After staying at the court some time, he set forth, 
with his numerous train of attendants, to return home.&nbsp; They
were to embark at Dover.&nbsp; Entering that peaceful town in 
armour, they took possession of the best houses, and noisily 
demanded to be lodged and entertained without payment.&nbsp; One 
of the bold men of Dover, who would not endure to have these 
domineering strangers jingling their heavy swords and iron 
corselets up and down his house, eating his meat and drinking his
strong liquor, stood in his doorway and refused admission to the 
first armed man who came there.&nbsp; The armed man drew, and 
wounded him.&nbsp; The man of Dover struck the armed man 
dead.&nbsp; Intelligence of what he had done, spreading through 
the streets to where the Count Eustace and his men were standing 
by their horses, bridle in hand, they passionately mounted, 
galloped to the house, surrounded it, forced their way in (the 
doors and windows being closed when they came up), and killed the
man of Dover at his own fireside.&nbsp; They then clattered 
through the streets, cutting down and riding over men, women, and
children.&nbsp; This did not last long, you may believe.&nbsp; 
The men of Dover set upon them with great fury, killed nineteen 
of the foreigners, wounded many more, and, blockading the road to
the port so that they should not embark, beat them out of the 
town by the way they had come.&nbsp; Hereupon, Count Eustace 
rides as hard as man can ride to Gloucester, where Edward is, 
surrounded by Norman monks and Norman lords.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Justice!&rsquo; cries the Count, &lsquo;upon the men of 
Dover, who have set upon and slain my people!&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
King sends immediately for the powerful Earl Godwin, who happens 
to be near; reminds him that Dover is under his government; and 
orders him to repair to Dover and do military execution on the 
inhabitants.&nbsp; &lsquo;It does not become you,&rsquo; says the
proud Earl in reply, &lsquo;to condemn without a hearing those 
whom you have sworn to protect.&nbsp; I will not do 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King, therefore, summoned the Earl, on pain of banishment 
and loss of his titles and property, to appear before the court 
to answer this disobedience.&nbsp; The Earl refused to 
appear.&nbsp; He, his eldest son Harold, and his second son 
Sweyn, hastily raised as many fighting men as their utmost power 
could collect, and demanded to have Count Eustace and his 
followers surrendered to the justice of the country.&nbsp; The 
King, in his turn, refused to give them up, and raised a strong 
force.&nbsp; After some treaty and delay, the troops of the great
Earl and his sons began to fall off.&nbsp; The Earl, with a part 
of his family and abundance of treasure, sailed to Flanders; 
Harold escaped to Ireland; and the power of the great family was 
for that time gone in England.&nbsp; But, the people did not 
forget them.</p>
<p>Then, Edward the Confessor, with the true meanness of a mean 
spirit, visited his dislike of the once powerful father and sons 
upon the helpless daughter and sister, his unoffending wife, whom
all who saw her (her husband and his monks excepted) loved.&nbsp;
He seized rapaciously upon her fortune and her jewels, and 
allowing her only one attendant, confined her in a gloomy 
convent, of which a sister of his&mdash;no doubt an unpleasant 
lady after his own heart&mdash;was abbess or jailer.</p>
<p>Having got Earl Godwin and his six sons well out of his way, 
the King favoured the Normans more than ever.&nbsp; He invited 
over <span class="smcap">William</span>, <span class="smcap">Duke
Of Normandy</span>, the son of that Duke who had received him and
his murdered brother long ago, and of a peasant girl, a 
tanner&rsquo;s daughter, with whom that Duke had fallen in love 
for her beauty as he saw her washing clothes in a brook.&nbsp; 
William, who was a great warrior, with a passion for fine horses,
dogs, and arms, accepted the invitation; and the Normans in 
England, finding themselves more numerous than ever when he 
arrived with his retinue, and held in still greater honour at 
court than before, became more and more haughty towards the 
people, and were more and more disliked by them.</p>
<p>The old Earl Godwin, though he was abroad, knew well how the 
people felt; for, with part of the treasure he had carried away 
with him, he kept spies and agents in his pay all over 
England.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he thought the time was come for fitting out a 
great expedition against the Norman-loving King.&nbsp; With it, 
he sailed to the Isle of Wight, where he was joined by his son 
Harold, the most gallant and brave of all his family.&nbsp; And 
so the father and son came sailing up the Thames to Southwark; 
great numbers of the people declaring for them, and shouting for 
the English Earl and the English Harold, against the Norman 
favourites!</p>
<p>The King was at first as blind and stubborn as kings usually 
have been whensoever they have been in the hands of monks.&nbsp; 
But the people rallied so thickly round the old Earl and his son,
and the old Earl was so steady in demanding without bloodshed the
restoration of himself and his family to their rights, that at 
last the court took the alarm.&nbsp; The Norman Archbishop of 
Canterbury, and the Norman Bishop of London, surrounded by their 
retainers, fought their way out of London, and escaped from Essex
to France in a fishing-boat.&nbsp; The other Norman favourites 
dispersed in all directions.&nbsp; The old Earl and his sons 
(except Sweyn, who had committed crimes against the law) were 
restored to their possessions and dignities.&nbsp; Editha, the 
virtuous and lovely Queen of the insensible King, was 
triumphantly released from her prison, the convent, and once more
sat in her chair of state, arrayed in the jewels of which, when 
she had no champion to support her rights, her cold-blooded 
husband had deprived her.</p>
<p>The old Earl Godwin did not long enjoy his restored 
fortune.&nbsp; He fell down in a fit at the King&rsquo;s table, 
and died upon the third day afterwards.&nbsp; Harold succeeded to
his power, and to a far higher place in the attachment of the 
people than his father had ever held.&nbsp; By his valour he 
subdued the King&rsquo;s enemies in many bloody fights.&nbsp; He 
was vigorous against rebels in Scotland&mdash;this was the time 
when Macbeth slew Duncan, upon which event our English 
Shakespeare, hundreds of years afterwards, wrote his great 
tragedy; and he killed the restless Welsh King <span 
class="smcap">Griffith</span>, and brought his head to 
England.</p>
<p>What Harold was doing at sea, when he was driven on the French
coast by a tempest, is not at all certain; nor does it at all 
matter.&nbsp; That his ship was forced by a storm on that shore, 
and that he was taken prisoner, there is no doubt.&nbsp; In those
barbarous days, all shipwrecked strangers were taken prisoners, 
and obliged to pay ransom.&nbsp; So, a certain Count Guy, who was
the Lord of Ponthieu where Harold&rsquo;s disaster happened, 
seized him, instead of relieving him like a hospitable and 
Christian lord as he ought to have done, and expected to make a 
very good thing of it.</p>
<p>But Harold sent off immediately to Duke William of Normandy, 
complaining of this treatment; and the Duke no sooner heard of it
than he ordered Harold to be escorted to the ancient town of 
Rouen, where he then was, and where he received him as an 
honoured guest.&nbsp; Now, some writers tell us that Edward the 
Confessor, who was by this time old and had no children, had made
a will, appointing Duke William of Normandy his successor, and 
had informed the Duke of his having done so.&nbsp; There is no 
doubt that he was anxious about his successor; because he had 
even invited over, from abroad, <span class="smcap">Edward the 
Outlaw</span>, a son of Ironside, who had come to England with 
his wife and three children, but whom the King had strangely 
refused to see when he did come, and who had died in London 
suddenly (princes were terribly liable to sudden death in those 
days), and had been buried in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.&nbsp; 
The King might possibly have made such a will; or, having always 
been fond of the Normans, he might have encouraged Norman William
to aspire to the English crown, by something that he said to him 
when he was staying at the English court.&nbsp; But, certainly 
William did now aspire to it; and knowing that Harold would be a 
powerful rival, he called together a great assembly of his 
nobles, offered Harold his daughter <span 
class="smcap">Adele</span> in marriage, informed him that he 
meant on King Edward&rsquo;s death to claim the English crown as 
his own inheritance, and required Harold then and there to swear 
to aid him.&nbsp; Harold, being in the Duke&rsquo;s power, took 
this oath upon the Missal, or Prayer-book.&nbsp; It is a good 
example of the superstitions of the monks, that this Missal, 
instead of being placed upon a table, was placed upon a tub; 
which, when Harold had sworn, was uncovered, and shown to be full
of dead men&rsquo;s bones&mdash;bones, as the monks pretended, of
saints.&nbsp; This was supposed to make Harold&rsquo;s oath a 
great deal more impressive and binding.&nbsp; As if the great 
name of the Creator of Heaven and earth could be made more solemn
by a knuckle-bone, or a double-tooth, or a finger-nail, of 
Dunstan!</p>
<p>Within a week or two after Harold&rsquo;s return to England, 
the dreary old Confessor was found to be dying.&nbsp; After 
wandering in his mind like a very weak old man, he died.&nbsp; As
he had put himself entirely in the hands of the monks when he was
alive, they praised him lustily when he was dead.&nbsp; They had 
gone so far, already, as to persuade him that he could work 
miracles; and had brought people afflicted with a bad disorder of
the skin, to him, to be touched and cured.&nbsp; This was called 
&lsquo;touching for the King&rsquo;s Evil,&rsquo; which 
afterwards became a royal custom.&nbsp; You know, however, Who 
really touched the sick, and healed them; and you know His sacred
name is not among the dusty line of human kings.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD THE SECOND, AND 
CONQUERED BY THE NORMANS</h2>
<p>Harold was crowned King of England on the very day of the 
maudlin Confessor&rsquo;s funeral.&nbsp; He had good need to be 
quick about it.&nbsp; When the news reached Norman William, 
hunting in his park at Rouen, he dropped his bow, returned to his
palace, called his nobles to council, and presently sent 
ambassadors to Harold, calling on him to keep his oath and resign
the Crown.&nbsp; Harold would do no such thing.&nbsp; The barons 
of France leagued together round Duke William for the invasion of
England.&nbsp; Duke William promised freely to distribute English
wealth and English lands among them.&nbsp; The Pope sent to 
Normandy a consecrated banner, and a ring containing a hair which
he warranted to have grown on the head of Saint Peter.&nbsp; He 
blessed the enterprise; and cursed Harold; and requested that the
Normans would pay &lsquo;Peter&rsquo;s Pence&rsquo;&mdash;or a 
tax to himself of a penny a year on every house&mdash;a little 
more regularly in future, if they could make it convenient.</p>
<p>King Harold had a rebel brother in Flanders, who was a vassal 
of <span class="smcap">Harold Hardrada</span>, King of 
Norway.&nbsp; This brother, and this Norwegian King, joining 
their forces against England, with Duke William&rsquo;s help, won
a fight in which the English were commanded by two nobles; and 
then besieged York.&nbsp; Harold, who was waiting for the Normans
on the coast at Hastings, with his army, marched to Stamford 
Bridge upon the river Derwent to give them instant battle.</p>
<p>He found them drawn up in a hollow circle, marked out by their
shining spears.&nbsp; Riding round this circle at a distance, to 
survey it, he saw a brave figure on horseback, in a blue mantle 
and a bright helmet, whose horse suddenly stumbled and threw 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that man who has fallen?&rsquo; Harold asked of 
one of his captains.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The King of Norway,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a tall and stately king,&rsquo; said Harold, 
&lsquo;but his end is near.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added, in a little while, &lsquo;Go yonder to my brother, 
and tell him, if he withdraw his troops, he shall be Earl of 
Northumberland, and rich and powerful in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The captain rode away and gave the message.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What will he give to my friend the King of 
Norway?&rsquo; asked the brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seven feet of earth for a grave,&rsquo; replied the 
captain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more?&rsquo; returned the brother, with a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The King of Norway being a tall man, perhaps a little 
more,&rsquo; replied the captain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ride back!&rsquo; said the brother, &lsquo;and tell 
King Harold to make ready for the fight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did so, very soon.&nbsp; And such a fight King Harold led 
against that force, that his brother, and the Norwegian King, and
every chief of note in all their host, except the Norwegian 
King&rsquo;s son, Olave, to whom he gave honourable dismissal, 
were left dead upon the field.&nbsp; The victorious army marched 
to York.&nbsp; As King Harold sat there at the feast, in the 
midst of all his company, a stir was heard at the doors; and 
messengers all covered with mire from riding far and fast through
broken ground came hurrying in, to report that the Normans had 
landed in England.</p>
<p>The intelligence was true.&nbsp; They had been tossed about by
contrary winds, and some of their ships had been wrecked.&nbsp; A
part of their own shore, to which they had been driven back, was 
strewn with Norman bodies.&nbsp; But they had once more made 
sail, led by the Duke&rsquo;s own galley, a present from his 
wife, upon the prow whereof the figure of a golden boy stood 
pointing towards England.&nbsp; By day, the banner of the three 
Lions of Normandy, the diverse coloured sails, the gilded vans, 
the many decorations of this gorgeous ship, had glittered in the 
sun and sunny water; by night, a light had sparkled like a star 
at her mast-head.&nbsp; And now, encamped near Hastings, with 
their leader lying in the old Roman castle of Pevensey, the 
English retiring in all directions, the land for miles around 
scorched and smoking, fired and pillaged, was the whole Norman 
power, hopeful and strong on English ground.</p>
<p>Harold broke up the feast and hurried to London.&nbsp; Within 
a week, his army was ready.&nbsp; He sent out spies to ascertain 
the Norman strength.&nbsp; William took them, caused them to be 
led through his whole camp, and then dismissed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The 
Normans,&rsquo; said these spies to Harold, &lsquo;are not 
bearded on the upper lip as we English are, but are shorn.&nbsp; 
They are priests.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My men,&rsquo; replied 
Harold, with a laugh, &lsquo;will find those priests good 
soldiers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Saxons,&rsquo; reported Duke William&rsquo;s 
outposts of Norman soldiers, who were instructed to retire as 
King Harold&rsquo;s army advanced, &lsquo;rush on us through 
their pillaged country with the fury of madmen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let them come, and come soon!&rsquo; said Duke 
William.</p>
<p>Some proposals for a reconciliation were made, but were soon 
abandoned.&nbsp; In the middle of the month of October, in the 
year one thousand and sixty-six, the Normans and the English came
front to front.&nbsp; All night the armies lay encamped before 
each other, in a part of the country then called Senlac, now 
called (in remembrance of them) Battle.&nbsp; With the first dawn
of day, they arose.&nbsp; There, in the faint light, were the 
English on a hill; a wood behind them; in their midst, the Royal 
banner, representing a fighting warrior, woven in gold thread, 
adorned with precious stones; beneath the banner, as it rustled 
in the wind, stood King Harold on foot, with two of his remaining
brothers by his side; around them, still and silent as the dead, 
clustered the whole English army&mdash;every soldier covered by 
his shield, and bearing in his hand his dreaded English 
battle-axe.</p>
<p>On an opposite hill, in three lines, archers, foot-soldiers, 
horsemen, was the Norman force.&nbsp; Of a sudden, a great 
battle-cry, &lsquo;God help us!&rsquo; burst from the Norman 
lines.&nbsp; The English answered with their own battle-cry, 
&lsquo;God&rsquo;s Rood!&nbsp; Holy Rood!&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
Normans then came sweeping down the hill to attack the 
English.</p>
<p>There was one tall Norman Knight who rode before the Norman 
army on a prancing horse, throwing up his heavy sword and 
catching it, and singing of the bravery of his countrymen.&nbsp; 
An English Knight, who rode out from the English force to meet 
him, fell by this Knight&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Another English 
Knight rode out, and he fell too.&nbsp; But then a third rode 
out, and killed the Norman.&nbsp; This was in the first beginning
of the fight.&nbsp; It soon raged everywhere.</p>
<p>The English, keeping side by side in a great mass, cared no 
more for the showers of Norman arrows than if they had been 
showers of Norman rain.&nbsp; When the Norman horsemen rode 
against them, with their battle-axes they cut men and horses 
down.&nbsp; The Normans gave way.&nbsp; The English pressed 
forward.&nbsp; A cry went forth among the Norman troops that Duke
William was killed.&nbsp; Duke William took off his helmet, in 
order that his face might be distinctly seen, and rode along the 
line before his men.&nbsp; This gave them courage.&nbsp; As they 
turned again to face the English, some of their Norman horse 
divided the pursuing body of the English from the rest, and thus 
all that foremost portion of the English army fell, fighting 
bravely.&nbsp; The main body still remaining firm, heedless of 
the Norman arrows, and with their battle-axes cutting down the 
crowds of horsemen when they rode up, like forests of young 
trees, Duke William pretended to retreat.&nbsp; The eager English
followed.&nbsp; The Norman army closed again, and fell upon them 
with great slaughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still,&rsquo; said Duke William, &lsquo;there are 
thousands of the English, firms as rocks around their King.&nbsp;
Shoot upward, Norman archers, that your arrows may fall down upon
their faces!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sun rose high, and sank, and the battle still raged.&nbsp;
Through all the wild October day, the clash and din resounded in 
the air.&nbsp; In the red sunset, and in the white moonlight, 
heaps upon heaps of dead men lay strewn, a dreadful spectacle, 
all over the ground.</p>
<p>King Harold, wounded with an arrow in the eye, was nearly 
blind.&nbsp; His brothers were already killed.&nbsp; Twenty 
Norman Knights, whose battered armour had flashed fiery and 
golden in the sunshine all day long, and now looked silvery in 
the moonlight, dashed forward to seize the Royal banner from the 
English Knights and soldiers, still faithfully collected round 
their blinded King.&nbsp; The King received a mortal wound, and 
dropped.&nbsp; The English broke and fled.&nbsp; The Normans 
rallied, and the day was lost.</p>
<p>O what a sight beneath the moon and stars, when lights were 
shining in the tent of the victorious Duke William, which was 
pitched near the spot where Harold fell&mdash;and he and his 
knights were carousing, within&mdash;and soldiers with torches, 
going slowly to and fro, without, sought for the corpse of Harold
among piles of dead&mdash;and the Warrior, worked in golden 
thread and precious stones, lay low, all torn and soiled with 
blood&mdash;and the three Norman Lions kept watch over the 
field!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE FIRST, THE 
NORMAN CONQUEROR</h2>
<p>Upon the ground where the brave Harold fell, William the 
Norman afterwards founded an abbey, which, under the name of 
Battle Abbey, was a rich and splendid place through many a 
troubled year, though now it is a grey ruin overgrown with 
ivy.&nbsp; But the first work he had to do, was to conquer the 
English thoroughly; and that, as you know by this time, was hard 
work for any man.</p>
<p>He ravaged several counties; he burned and plundered many 
towns; he laid waste scores upon scores of miles of pleasant 
country; he destroyed innumerable lives.&nbsp; At length <span 
class="smcap">Stigand</span>, Archbishop of Canterbury, with 
other representatives of the clergy and the people, went to his 
camp, and submitted to him.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Edgar</span>, the insignificant son of Edmund 
Ironside, was proclaimed King by others, but nothing came of 
it.&nbsp; He fled to Scotland afterwards, where his sister, who 
was young and beautiful, married the Scottish King.&nbsp; Edgar 
himself was not important enough for anybody to care much about 
him.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, William was crowned in Westminster Abbey, 
under the title of <span class="smcap">William the First</span>; 
but he is best known as <span class="smcap">William the 
Conqueror</span>.&nbsp; It was a strange coronation.&nbsp; One of
the bishops who performed the ceremony asked the Normans, in 
French, if they would have Duke William for their king?&nbsp; 
They answered Yes.&nbsp; Another of the bishops put the same 
question to the Saxons, in English.&nbsp; They too answered Yes, 
with a loud shout.&nbsp; The noise being heard by a guard of 
Norman horse-soldiers outside, was mistaken for resistance on the
part of the English.&nbsp; The guard instantly set fire to the 
neighbouring houses, and a tumult ensued; in the midst of which 
the King, being left alone in the Abbey, with a few priests (and 
they all being in a terrible fright together), was hurriedly 
crowned.&nbsp; When the crown was placed upon his head, he swore 
to govern the English as well as the best of their own 
monarchs.&nbsp; I dare say you think, as I do, that if we except 
the Great Alfred, he might pretty easily have done that.</p>
<p>Numbers of the English nobles had been killed in the last 
disastrous battle.&nbsp; Their estates, and the estates of all 
the nobles who had fought against him there, King William seized 
upon, and gave to his own Norman knights and nobles.&nbsp; Many 
great English families of the present time acquired their English
lands in this way, and are very proud of it.</p>
<p>But what is got by force must be maintained by force.&nbsp; 
These nobles were obliged to build castles all over England, to 
defend their new property; and, do what he would, the King could 
neither soothe nor quell the nation as he wished.&nbsp; He 
gradually introduced the Norman language and the Norman customs; 
yet, for a long time the great body of the English remained 
sullen and revengeful.&nbsp; On his going over to Normandy, to 
visit his subjects there, the oppressions of his half-brother 
<span class="smcap">Odo</span>, whom he left in charge of his 
English kingdom, drove the people mad.&nbsp; The men of Kent even
invited over, to take possession of Dover, their old enemy Count 
Eustace of Boulogne, who had led the fray when the Dover man was 
slain at his own fireside.&nbsp; The men of Hereford, aided by 
the Welsh, and commanded by a chief named <span 
class="smcap">Edric the Wild</span>, drove the Normans out of 
their country.&nbsp; Some of those who had been dispossessed of 
their lands, banded together in the North of England; some, in 
Scotland; some, in the thick woods and marshes; and whensoever 
they could fall upon the Normans, or upon the English who had 
submitted to the Normans, they fought, despoiled, and murdered, 
like the desperate outlaws that they were.&nbsp; Conspiracies 
were set on foot for a general massacre of the Normans, like the 
old massacre of the Danes.&nbsp; In short, the English were in a 
murderous mood all through the kingdom.</p>
<p>King William, fearing he might lose his conquest, came back, 
and tried to pacify the London people by soft words.&nbsp; He 
then set forth to repress the country people by stern 
deeds.&nbsp; Among the towns which he besieged, and where he 
killed and maimed the inhabitants without any distinction, 
sparing none, young or old, armed or unarmed, were Oxford, 
Warwick, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Lincoln, York.&nbsp; In 
all these places, and in many others, fire and sword worked their
utmost horrors, and made the land dreadful to behold.&nbsp; The 
streams and rivers were discoloured with blood; the sky was 
blackened with smoke; the fields were wastes of ashes; the 
waysides were heaped up with dead.&nbsp; Such are the fatal 
results of conquest and ambition!&nbsp; Although William was a 
harsh and angry man, I do not suppose that he deliberately meant 
to work this shocking ruin, when he invaded England.&nbsp; But 
what he had got by the strong hand, he could only keep by the 
strong hand, and in so doing he made England a great grave.</p>
<p>Two sons of Harold, by name <span class="smcap">Edmund</span> 
and <span class="smcap">Godwin</span>, came over from Ireland, 
with some ships, against the Normans, but were defeated.&nbsp; 
This was scarcely done, when the outlaws in the woods so harassed
York, that the Governor sent to the King for help.&nbsp; The King
despatched a general and a large force to occupy the town of 
Durham.&nbsp; The Bishop of that place met the general outside 
the town, and warned him not to enter, as he would be in danger 
there.&nbsp; The general cared nothing for the warning, and went 
in with all his men.&nbsp; That night, on every hill within sight
of Durham, signal fires were seen to blaze.&nbsp; When the 
morning dawned, the English, who had assembled in great strength,
forced the gates, rushed into the town, and slew the Normans 
every one.&nbsp; The English afterwards besought the Danes to 
come and help them.&nbsp; The Danes came, with two hundred and 
forty ships.&nbsp; The outlawed nobles joined them; they captured
York, and drove the Normans out of that city.&nbsp; Then, William
bribed the Danes to go away; and took such vengeance on the 
English, that all the former fire and sword, smoke and ashes, 
death and ruin, were nothing compared with it.&nbsp; In 
melancholy songs, and doleful stories, it was still sung and told
by cottage fires on winter evenings, a hundred years afterwards, 
how, in those dreadful days of the Normans, there was not, from 
the River Humber to the River Tyne, one inhabited village left, 
nor one cultivated field&mdash;how there was nothing but a dismal
ruin, where the human creatures and the beasts lay dead 
together.</p>
<p>The outlaws had, at this time, what they called a Camp of 
Refuge, in the midst of the fens of Cambridgeshire.&nbsp; 
Protected by those marshy grounds which were difficult of 
approach, they lay among the reeds and rushes, and were hidden by
the mists that rose up from the watery earth.&nbsp; Now, there 
also was, at that time, over the sea in Flanders, an Englishman 
named <span class="smcap">Hereward</span>, whose father had died 
in his absence, and whose property had been given to a 
Norman.&nbsp; When he heard of this wrong that had been done him 
(from such of the exiled English as chanced to wander into that 
country), he longed for revenge; and joining the outlaws in their
camp of refuge, became their commander.&nbsp; He was so good a 
soldier, that the Normans supposed him to be aided by 
enchantment.&nbsp; William, even after he had made a road three 
miles in length across the Cambridgeshire marshes, on purpose to 
attack this supposed enchanter, thought it necessary to engage an
old lady, who pretended to be a sorceress, to come and do a 
little enchantment in the royal cause.&nbsp; For this purpose she
was pushed on before the troops in a wooden tower; but Hereward 
very soon disposed of this unfortunate sorceress, by burning her,
tower and all.&nbsp; The monks of the convent of Ely near at 
hand, however, who were fond of good living, and who found it 
very uncomfortable to have the country blockaded and their 
supplies of meat and drink cut off, showed the King a secret way 
of surprising the camp.&nbsp; So Hereward was soon 
defeated.&nbsp; Whether he afterwards died quietly, or whether he
was killed after killing sixteen of the men who attacked him (as 
some old rhymes relate that he did), I cannot say.&nbsp; His 
defeat put an end to the Camp of Refuge; and, very soon 
afterwards, the King, victorious both in Scotland and in England,
quelled the last rebellious English noble.&nbsp; He then 
surrounded himself with Norman lords, enriched by the property of
English nobles; had a great survey made of all the land in 
England, which was entered as the property of its new owners, on 
a roll called Doomsday Book; obliged the people to put out their 
fires and candles at a certain hour every night, on the ringing 
of a bell which was called The Curfew; introduced the Norman 
dresses and manners; made the Normans masters everywhere, and the
English, servants; turned out the English bishops, and put 
Normans in their places; and showed himself to be the Conqueror 
indeed.</p>
<p>But, even with his own Normans, he had a restless life.&nbsp; 
They were always hungering and thirsting for the riches of the 
English; and the more he gave, the more they wanted.&nbsp; His 
priests were as greedy as his soldiers.&nbsp; We know of only one
Norman who plainly told his master, the King, that he had come 
with him to England to do his duty as a faithful servant, and 
that property taken by force from other men had no charms for 
him.&nbsp; His name was <span 
class="smcap">Guilbert</span>.&nbsp; We should not forget his 
name, for it is good to remember and to honour honest men.</p>
<p>Besides all these troubles, William the Conqueror was troubled
by quarrels among his sons.&nbsp; He had three living.&nbsp; 
<span class="smcap">Robert</span>, called <span 
class="smcap">Curthose</span>, because of his short legs; <span 
class="smcap">William</span>, called <span 
class="smcap">Rufus</span> or the Red, from the colour of his 
hair; and <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, fond of learning, and
called, in the Norman language, <span 
class="smcap">Beauclerc</span>, or Fine-Scholar.&nbsp; When 
Robert grew up, he asked of his father the government of 
Normandy, which he had nominally possessed, as a child, under his
mother, <span class="smcap">Matilda</span>.&nbsp; The King 
refusing to grant it, Robert became jealous and discontented; and
happening one day, while in this temper, to be ridiculed by his 
brothers, who threw water on him from a balcony as he was walking
before the door, he drew his sword, rushed up-stairs, and was 
only prevented by the King himself from putting them to 
death.&nbsp; That same night, he hotly departed with some 
followers from his father&rsquo;s court, and endeavoured to take 
the Castle of Rouen by surprise.&nbsp; Failing in this, he shut 
himself up in another Castle in Normandy, which the King 
besieged, and where Robert one day unhorsed and nearly killed him
without knowing who he was.&nbsp; His submission when he 
discovered his father, and the intercession of the queen and 
others, reconciled them; but not soundly; for Robert soon strayed
abroad, and went from court to court with his complaints.&nbsp; 
He was a gay, careless, thoughtless fellow, spending all he got 
on musicians and dancers; but his mother loved him, and often, 
against the King&rsquo;s command, supplied him with money through
a messenger named <span class="smcap">Samson</span>.&nbsp; At 
length the incensed King swore he would tear out Samson&rsquo;s 
eyes; and Samson, thinking that his only hope of safety was in 
becoming a monk, became one, went on such errands no more, and 
kept his eyes in his head.</p>
<p>All this time, from the turbulent day of his strange 
coronation, the Conqueror had been struggling, you see, at any 
cost of cruelty and bloodshed, to maintain what he had 
seized.&nbsp; All his reign, he struggled still, with the same 
object ever before him.&nbsp; He was a stern, bold man, and he 
succeeded in it.</p>
<p>He loved money, and was particular in his eating, but he had 
only leisure to indulge one other passion, and that was his love 
of hunting.&nbsp; He carried it to such a height that he ordered 
whole villages and towns to be swept away to make forests for the
deer.&nbsp; Not satisfied with sixty-eight Royal Forests, he laid
waste an immense district, to form another in Hampshire, called 
the New Forest.&nbsp; The many thousands of miserable peasants 
who saw their little houses pulled down, and themselves and 
children turned into the open country without a shelter, detested
him for his merciless addition to their many sufferings; and 
when, in the twenty-first year of his reign (which proved to be 
the last), he went over to Rouen, England was as full of hatred 
against him, as if every leaf on every tree in all his Royal 
Forests had been a curse upon his head.&nbsp; In the New Forest, 
his son Richard (for he had four sons) had been gored to death by
a Stag; and the people said that this so cruelly-made Forest 
would yet be fatal to others of the Conqueror&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>He was engaged in a dispute with the King of France about some
territory.&nbsp; While he stayed at Rouen, negotiating with that 
King, he kept his bed and took medicines: being advised by his 
physicians to do so, on account of having grown to an unwieldy 
size.&nbsp; Word being brought to him that the King of France 
made light of this, and joked about it, he swore in a great rage 
that he should rue his jests.&nbsp; He assembled his army, 
marched into the disputed territory, burnt&mdash;his old 
way!&mdash;the vines, the crops, and fruit, and set the town of 
Mantes on fire.&nbsp; But, in an evil hour; for, as he rode over 
the hot ruins, his horse, setting his hoofs upon some burning 
embers, started, threw him forward against the pommel of the 
saddle, and gave him a mortal hurt.&nbsp; For six weeks he lay 
dying in a monastery near Rouen, and then made his will, giving 
England to William, Normandy to Robert, and five thousand pounds 
to Henry.&nbsp; And now, his violent deeds lay heavy on his 
mind.&nbsp; He ordered money to be given to many English churches
and monasteries, and&mdash;which was much better 
repentance&mdash;released his prisoners of state, some of whom 
had been confined in his dungeons twenty years.</p>
<p>It was a September morning, and the sun was rising, when the 
King was awakened from slumber by the sound of a church 
bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;What bell is that?&rsquo; he faintly 
asked.&nbsp; They told him it was the bell of the chapel of Saint
Mary.&nbsp; &lsquo;I commend my soul,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to 
Mary!&rsquo; and died.</p>
<p>Think of his name, The Conqueror, and then consider how he lay
in death!&nbsp; The moment he was dead, his physicians, priests, 
and nobles, not knowing what contest for the throne might now 
take place, or what might happen in it, hastened away, each man 
for himself and his own property; the mercenary servants of the 
court began to rob and plunder; the body of the King, in the 
indecent strife, was rolled from the bed, and lay alone, for 
hours, upon the ground.&nbsp; O Conqueror, of whom so many great 
names are proud now, of whom so many great names thought nothing 
then, it were better to have conquered one true heart, than 
England!</p>
<p>By-and-by, the priests came creeping in with prayers and 
candles; and a good knight, named <span 
class="smcap">Herluin</span>, undertook (which no one else would 
do) to convey the body to Caen, in Normandy, in order that it 
might be buried in St. Stephen&rsquo;s church there, which the 
Conqueror had founded.&nbsp; But fire, of which he had made such 
bad use in his life, seemed to follow him of itself in 
death.&nbsp; A great conflagration broke out in the town when the
body was placed in the church; and those present running out to 
extinguish the flames, it was once again left alone.</p>
<p>It was not even buried in peace.&nbsp; It was about to be let 
down, in its Royal robes, into a tomb near the high altar, in 
presence of a great concourse of people, when a loud voice in the
crowd cried out, &lsquo;This ground is mine!&nbsp; Upon it, stood
my father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; This King despoiled me of both 
ground and house to build this church.&nbsp; In the great name of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, I here forbid his body to be 
covered with the earth that is my right!&rsquo;&nbsp; The priests
and bishops present, knowing the speaker&rsquo;s right, and 
knowing that the King had often denied him justice, paid him down
sixty shillings for the grave.&nbsp; Even then, the corpse was 
not at rest.&nbsp; The tomb was too small, and they tried to 
force it in.&nbsp; It broke, a dreadful smell arose, the people 
hurried out into the air, and, for the third time, it was left 
alone.</p>
<p>Where were the Conqueror&rsquo;s three sons, that they were 
not at their father&rsquo;s burial?&nbsp; Robert was lounging 
among minstrels, dancers, and gamesters, in France or 
Germany.&nbsp; Henry was carrying his five thousand pounds safely
away in a convenient chest he had got made.&nbsp; William the Red
was hurrying to England, to lay hands upon the Royal treasure and
the crown.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE SECOND, CALLED 
RUFUS</h2>
<p>William the Red, in breathless haste, secured the three great 
forts of Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings, and made with hot speed 
for Winchester, where the Royal treasure was kept.&nbsp; The 
treasurer delivering him the keys, he found that it amounted to 
sixty thousand pounds in silver, besides gold and jewels.&nbsp; 
Possessed of this wealth, he soon persuaded the Archbishop of 
Canterbury to crown him, and became William the Second, King of 
England.</p>
<p>Rufus was no sooner on the throne, than he ordered into prison
again the unhappy state captives whom his father had set free, 
and directed a goldsmith to ornament his father&rsquo;s tomb 
profusely with gold and silver.&nbsp; It would have been more 
dutiful in him to have attended the sick Conqueror when he was 
dying; but England itself, like this Red King, who once governed 
it, has sometimes made expensive tombs for dead men whom it 
treated shabbily when they were alive.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s brother, Robert of Normandy, seeming quite 
content to be only Duke of that country; and the King&rsquo;s 
other brother, Fine-Scholar, being quiet enough with his five 
thousand pounds in a chest; the King flattered himself, we may 
suppose, with the hope of an easy reign.&nbsp; But easy reigns 
were difficult to have in those days.&nbsp; The turbulent Bishop 
<span class="smcap">Odo</span> (who had blessed the Norman army 
at the Battle of Hastings, and who, I dare say, took all the 
credit of the victory to himself) soon began, in concert with 
some powerful Norman nobles, to trouble the Red King.</p>
<p>The truth seems to be that this bishop and his friends, who 
had lands in England and lands in Normandy, wished to hold both 
under one Sovereign; and greatly preferred a thoughtless 
good-natured person, such as Robert was, to Rufus; who, though 
far from being an amiable man in any respect, was keen, and not 
to be imposed upon.&nbsp; They declared in Robert&rsquo;s favour,
and retired to their castles (those castles were very troublesome
to kings) in a sullen humour.&nbsp; The Red King, seeing the 
Normans thus falling from him, revenged himself upon them by 
appealing to the English; to whom he made a variety of promises, 
which he never meant to perform&mdash;in particular, promises to 
soften the cruelty of the Forest Laws; and who, in return, so 
aided him with their valour, that <span class="smcap">Odo</span> 
was besieged in the Castle of Rochester, and forced to abandon 
it, and to depart from England for ever: whereupon the other 
rebellious Norman nobles were soon reduced and scattered.</p>
<p>Then, the Red King went over to Normandy, where the people 
suffered greatly under the loose rule of Duke Robert.&nbsp; The 
King&rsquo;s object was to seize upon the Duke&rsquo;s 
dominions.&nbsp; This, the Duke, of course, prepared to resist; 
and miserable war between the two brothers seemed inevitable, 
when the powerful nobles on both sides, who had seen so much of 
war, interfered to prevent it.&nbsp; A treaty was made.&nbsp; 
Each of the two brothers agreed to give up something of his 
claims, and that the longer-liver of the two should inherit all 
the dominions of the other.&nbsp; When they had come to this 
loving understanding, they embraced and joined their forces 
against Fine-Scholar; who had bought some territory of Robert 
with a part of his five thousand pounds, and was considered a 
dangerous individual in consequence.</p>
<p>St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, in Normandy (there is another St. 
Michael&rsquo;s Mount, in Cornwall, wonderfully like it), was 
then, as it is now, a strong place perched upon the top of a high
rock, around which, when the tide is in, the sea flows, leaving 
no road to the mainland.&nbsp; In this place, Fine-Scholar shut 
himself up with his soldiers, and here he was closely besieged by
his two brothers.&nbsp; At one time, when he was reduced to great
distress for want of water, the generous Robert not only 
permitted his men to get water, but sent Fine-Scholar wine from 
his own table; and, on being remonstrated with by the Red King, 
said &lsquo;What! shall we let our own brother die of 
thirst?&nbsp; Where shall we get another, when he is 
gone?&rsquo;&nbsp; At another time, the Red King riding alone on 
the shore of the bay, looking up at the Castle, was taken by two 
of Fine-Scholar&rsquo;s men, one of whom was about to kill him, 
when he cried out, &lsquo;Hold, knave!&nbsp; I am the King of 
England!&rsquo;&nbsp; The story says that the soldier raised him 
from the ground respectfully and humbly, and that the King took 
him into his service.&nbsp; The story may or may not be true; but
at any rate it is true that Fine-Scholar could not hold out 
against his united brothers, and that he abandoned Mount St. 
Michael, and wandered about&mdash;as poor and forlorn as other 
scholars have been sometimes known to be.</p>
<p>The Scotch became unquiet in the Red King&rsquo;s time, and 
were twice defeated&mdash;the second time, with the loss of their
King, Malcolm, and his son.&nbsp; The Welsh became unquiet 
too.&nbsp; Against them, Rufus was less successful; for they 
fought among their native mountains, and did great execution on 
the King&rsquo;s troops.&nbsp; Robert of Normandy became unquiet 
too; and, complaining that his brother the King did not 
faithfully perform his part of their agreement, took up arms, and
obtained assistance from the King of France, whom Rufus, in the 
end, bought off with vast sums of money.&nbsp; England became 
unquiet too.&nbsp; Lord Mowbray, the powerful Earl of 
Northumberland, headed a great conspiracy to depose the King, and
to place upon the throne, <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, the
Conqueror&rsquo;s near relative.&nbsp; The plot was discovered; 
all the chief conspirators were seized; some were fined, some 
were put in prison, some were put to death.&nbsp; The Earl of 
Northumberland himself was shut up in a dungeon beneath Windsor 
Castle, where he died, an old man, thirty long years 
afterwards.&nbsp; The Priests in England were more unquiet than 
any other class or power; for the Red King treated them with such
small ceremony that he refused to appoint new bishops or 
archbishops when the old ones died, but kept all the wealth 
belonging to those offices in his own hands.&nbsp; In return for 
this, the Priests wrote his life when he was dead, and abused him
well.&nbsp; I am inclined to think, myself, that there was little
to choose between the Priests and the Red King; that both sides 
were greedy and designing; and that they were fairly matched.</p>
<p>The Red King was false of heart, selfish, covetous, and 
mean.&nbsp; He had a worthy minister in his favourite, Ralph, 
nicknamed&mdash;for almost every famous person had a nickname in 
those rough days&mdash;Flambard, or the Firebrand.&nbsp; Once, 
the King being ill, became penitent, and made <span 
class="smcap">Anselm</span>, a foreign priest and a good man, 
Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; But he no sooner got well again 
than he repented of his repentance, and persisted in wrongfully 
keeping to himself some of the wealth belonging to the 
archbishopric.&nbsp; This led to violent disputes, which were 
aggravated by there being in Rome at that time two rival Popes; 
each of whom declared he was the only real original infallible 
Pope, who couldn&rsquo;t make a mistake.&nbsp; At last, Anselm, 
knowing the Red King&rsquo;s character, and not feeling himself 
safe in England, asked leave to return abroad.&nbsp; The Red King
gladly gave it; for he knew that as soon as Anselm was gone, he 
could begin to store up all the Canterbury money again, for his 
own use.</p>
<p>By such means, and by taxing and oppressing the English people
in every possible way, the Red King became very rich.&nbsp; When 
he wanted money for any purpose, he raised it by some means or 
other, and cared nothing for the injustice he did, or the misery 
he caused.&nbsp; Having the opportunity of buying from Robert the
whole duchy of Normandy for five years, he taxed the English 
people more than ever, and made the very convents sell their 
plate and valuables to supply him with the means to make the 
purchase.&nbsp; But he was as quick and eager in putting down 
revolt as he was in raising money; for, a part of the Norman 
people objecting&mdash;very naturally, I think&mdash;to being 
sold in this way, he headed an army against them with all the 
speed and energy of his father.&nbsp; He was so impatient, that 
he embarked for Normandy in a great gale of wind.&nbsp; And when 
the sailors told him it was dangerous to go to sea in such angry 
weather, he replied, &lsquo;Hoist sail and away!&nbsp; Did you 
ever hear of a king who was drowned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>You will wonder how it was that even the careless Robert came 
to sell his dominions.&nbsp; It happened thus.&nbsp; It had long 
been the custom for many English people to make journeys to 
Jerusalem, which were called pilgrimages, in order that they 
might pray beside the tomb of Our Saviour there.&nbsp; Jerusalem 
belonging to the Turks, and the Turks hating Christianity, these 
Christian travellers were often insulted and ill used.&nbsp; The 
Pilgrims bore it patiently for some time, but at length a 
remarkable man, of great earnestness and eloquence, called <span 
class="smcap">Peter the Hermit</span>, began to preach in various
places against the Turks, and to declare that it was the duty of 
good Christians to drive away those unbelievers from the tomb of 
Our Saviour, and to take possession of it, and protect it.&nbsp; 
An excitement such as the world had never known before was 
created.&nbsp; Thousands and thousands of men of all ranks and 
conditions departed for Jerusalem to make war against the 
Turks.&nbsp; The war is called in history the first Crusade, and 
every Crusader wore a cross marked on his right shoulder.</p>
<p>All the Crusaders were not zealous Christians.&nbsp; Among 
them were vast numbers of the restless, idle, profligate, and 
adventurous spirit of the time.&nbsp; Some became Crusaders for 
the love of change; some, in the hope of plunder; some, because 
they had nothing to do at home; some, because they did what the 
priests told them; some, because they liked to see foreign 
countries; some, because they were fond of knocking men about, 
and would as soon knock a Turk about as a Christian.&nbsp; Robert
of Normandy may have been influenced by all these motives; and by
a kind desire, besides, to save the Christian Pilgrims from bad 
treatment in future.&nbsp; He wanted to raise a number of armed 
men, and to go to the Crusade.&nbsp; He could not do so without 
money.&nbsp; He had no money; and he sold his dominions to his 
brother, the Red King, for five years.&nbsp; With the large sum 
he thus obtained, he fitted out his Crusaders gallantly, and went
away to Jerusalem in martial state.&nbsp; The Red King, who made 
money out of everything, stayed at home, busily squeezing more 
money out of Normans and English.</p>
<p>After three years of great hardship and suffering&mdash;from 
shipwreck at sea; from travel in strange lands; from hunger, 
thirst, and fever, upon the burning sands of the desert; and from
the fury of the Turks&mdash;the valiant Crusaders got possession 
of Our Saviour&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; The Turks were still resisting
and fighting bravely, but this success increased the general 
desire in Europe to join the Crusade.&nbsp; Another great French 
Duke was proposing to sell his dominions for a term to the rich 
Red King, when the Red King&rsquo;s reign came to a sudden and 
violent end.</p>
<p>You have not forgotten the New Forest which the Conqueror 
made, and which the miserable people whose homes he had laid 
waste, so hated.&nbsp; The cruelty of the Forest Laws, and the 
torture and death they brought upon the peasantry, increased this
hatred.&nbsp; The poor persecuted country people believed that 
the New Forest was enchanted.&nbsp; They said that in 
thunder-storms, and on dark nights, demons appeared, moving 
beneath the branches of the gloomy trees.&nbsp; They said that a 
terrible spectre had foretold to Norman hunters that the Red King
should be punished there.&nbsp; And now, in the pleasant season 
of May, when the Red King had reigned almost thirteen years; and 
a second Prince of the Conqueror&rsquo;s blood&mdash;another 
Richard, the son of Duke Robert&mdash;was killed by an arrow in 
this dreaded Forest; the people said that the second time was not
the last, and that there was another death to come.</p>
<p>It was a lonely forest, accursed in the people&rsquo;s hearts 
for the wicked deeds that had been done to make it; and no man 
save the King and his Courtiers and Huntsmen, liked to stray 
there.&nbsp; But, in reality, it was like any other forest.&nbsp;
In the spring, the green leaves broke out of the buds; in the 
summer, flourished heartily, and made deep shades; in the winter,
shrivelled and blew down, and lay in brown heaps on the 
moss.&nbsp; Some trees were stately, and grew high and strong; 
some had fallen of themselves; some were felled by the 
forester&rsquo;s axe; some were hollow, and the rabbits burrowed 
at their roots; some few were struck by lightning, and stood 
white and bare.&nbsp; There were hill-sides covered with rich 
fern, on which the morning dew so beautifully sparkled; there 
were brooks, where the deer went down to drink, or over which the
whole herd bounded, flying from the arrows of the huntsmen; there
were sunny glades, and solemn places where but little light came 
through the rustling leaves.&nbsp; The songs of the birds in the 
New Forest were pleasanter to hear than the shouts of fighting 
men outside; and even when the Red King and his Court came 
hunting through its solitudes, cursing loud and riding hard, with
a jingling of stirrups and bridles and knives and daggers, they 
did much less harm there than among the English or Normans, and 
the stags died (as they lived) far easier than the people.</p>
<p>Upon a day in August, the Red King, now reconciled to his 
brother, Fine-Scholar, came with a great train to hunt in the New
Forest.&nbsp; Fine-Scholar was of the party.&nbsp; They were a 
merry party, and had lain all night at Malwood-Keep, a 
hunting-lodge in the forest, where they had made good cheer, both
at supper and breakfast, and had drunk a deal of wine.&nbsp; The 
party dispersed in various directions, as the custom of hunters 
then was.&nbsp; The King took with him only <span 
class="smcap">Sir Walter Tyrrel</span>, who was a famous 
sportsman, and to whom he had given, before they mounted horse 
that morning, two fine arrows.</p>
<p>The last time the King was ever seen alive, he was riding with
Sir Walter Tyrrel, and their dogs were hunting together.</p>
<p>It was almost night, when a poor charcoal-burner, passing 
through the forest with his cart, came upon the solitary body of 
a dead man, shot with an arrow in the breast, and still 
bleeding.&nbsp; He got it into his cart.&nbsp; It was the body of
the King.&nbsp; Shaken and tumbled, with its red beard all 
whitened with lime and clotted with blood, it was driven in the 
cart by the charcoal-burner next day to Winchester Cathedral, 
where it was received and buried.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Tyrrel, who escaped to Normandy, and claimed the 
protection of the King of France, swore in France that the Red 
King was suddenly shot dead by an arrow from an unseen hand, 
while they were hunting together; that he was fearful of being 
suspected as the King&rsquo;s murderer; and that he instantly set
spurs to his horse, and fled to the sea-shore.&nbsp; Others 
declared that the King and Sir Walter Tyrrel were hunting in 
company, a little before sunset, standing in bushes opposite one 
another, when a stag came between them.&nbsp; That the King drew 
his bow and took aim, but the string broke.&nbsp; That the King 
then cried, &lsquo;Shoot, Walter, in the Devil&rsquo;s 
name!&rsquo;&nbsp; That Sir Walter shot.&nbsp; That the arrow 
glanced against a tree, was turned aside from the stag, and 
struck the King from his horse, dead.</p>
<p>By whose hand the Red King really fell, and whether that hand 
despatched the arrow to his breast by accident or by design, is 
only known to <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Some think 
his brother may have caused him to be killed; but the Red King 
had made so many enemies, both among priests and people, that 
suspicion may reasonably rest upon a less unnatural 
murderer.&nbsp; Men know no more than that he was found dead in 
the New Forest, which the suffering people had regarded as a 
doomed ground for his race.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIRST, CALLED 
FINE-SCHOLAR</h2>
<p>Fine-scholar, on hearing of the Red King&rsquo;s death, 
hurried to Winchester with as much speed as Rufus himself had 
made, to seize the Royal treasure.&nbsp; But the keeper of the 
treasure who had been one of the hunting-party in the Forest, 
made haste to Winchester too, and, arriving there at about the 
same time, refused to yield it up.&nbsp; Upon this, Fine-Scholar 
drew his sword, and threatened to kill the treasurer; who might 
have paid for his fidelity with his life, but that he knew longer
resistance to be useless when he found the Prince supported by a 
company of powerful barons, who declared they were determined to 
make him King.&nbsp; The treasurer, therefore, gave up the money 
and jewels of the Crown: and on the third day after the death of 
the Red King, being a Sunday, Fine-Scholar stood before the high 
altar in Westminster Abbey, and made a solemn declaration that he
would resign the Church property which his brother had seized; 
that he would do no wrong to the nobles; and that he would 
restore to the people the laws of Edward the Confessor, with all 
the improvements of William the Conqueror.&nbsp; So began the 
reign of <span class="smcap">King Henry the First</span>.</p>
<p>The people were attached to their new King, both because he 
had known distresses, and because he was an Englishman by birth 
and not a Norman.&nbsp; To strengthen this last hold upon them, 
the King wished to marry an English lady; and could think of no 
other wife than <span class="smcap">Maud the Good</span>, the 
daughter of the King of Scotland.&nbsp; Although this good 
Princess did not love the King, she was so affected by the 
representations the nobles made to her of the great charity it 
would be in her to unite the Norman and Saxon races, and prevent 
hatred and bloodshed between them for the future, that she 
consented to become his wife.&nbsp; After some disputing among 
the priests, who said that as she had been in a convent in her 
youth, and had worn the veil of a nun, she could not lawfully be 
married&mdash;against which the Princess stated that her aunt, 
with whom she had lived in her youth, had indeed sometimes thrown
a piece of black stuff over her, but for no other reason than 
because the nun&rsquo;s veil was the only dress the conquering 
Normans respected in girl or woman, and not because she had taken
the vows of a nun, which she never had&mdash;she was declared 
free to marry, and was made King Henry&rsquo;s Queen.&nbsp; A 
good Queen she was; beautiful, kind-hearted, and worthy of a 
better husband than the King.</p>
<p>For he was a cunning and unscrupulous man, though firm and 
clever.&nbsp; He cared very little for his word, and took any 
means to gain his ends.&nbsp; All this is shown in his treatment 
of his brother Robert&mdash;Robert, who had suffered him to be 
refreshed with water, and who had sent him the wine from his own 
table, when he was shut up, with the crows flying below him, 
parched with thirst, in the castle on the top of St. 
Michael&rsquo;s Mount, where his Red brother would have let him 
die.</p>
<p>Before the King began to deal with Robert, he removed and 
disgraced all the favourites of the late King; who were for the 
most part base characters, much detested by the people.&nbsp; 
Flambard, or Firebrand, whom the late King had made Bishop of 
Durham, of all things in the world, Henry imprisoned in the 
Tower; but Firebrand was a great joker and a jolly companion, and
made himself so popular with his guards that they pretended to 
know nothing about a long rope that was sent into his prison at 
the bottom of a deep flagon of wine.&nbsp; The guards took the 
wine, and Firebrand took the rope; with which, when they were 
fast asleep, he let himself down from a window in the night, and 
so got cleverly aboard ship and away to Normandy.</p>
<p>Now Robert, when his brother Fine-Scholar came to the throne, 
was still absent in the Holy Land.&nbsp; Henry pretended that 
Robert had been made Sovereign of that country; and he had been 
away so long, that the ignorant people believed it.&nbsp; But, 
behold, when Henry had been some time King of England, Robert 
came home to Normandy; having leisurely returned from Jerusalem 
through Italy, in which beautiful country he had enjoyed himself 
very much, and had married a lady as beautiful as itself!&nbsp; 
In Normandy, he found Firebrand waiting to urge him to assert his
claim to the English crown, and declare war against King 
Henry.&nbsp; This, after great loss of time in feasting and 
dancing with his beautiful Italian wife among his Norman friends,
he at last did.</p>
<p>The English in general were on King Henry&rsquo;s side, though
many of the Normans were on Robert&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But the English
sailors deserted the King, and took a great part of the English 
fleet over to Normandy; so that Robert came to invade this 
country in no foreign vessels, but in English ships.&nbsp; The 
virtuous Anselm, however, whom Henry had invited back from 
abroad, and made Archbishop of Canterbury, was steadfast in the 
King&rsquo;s cause; and it was so well supported that the two 
armies, instead of fighting, made a peace.&nbsp; Poor Robert, who
trusted anybody and everybody, readily trusted his brother, the 
King; and agreed to go home and receive a pension from England, 
on condition that all his followers were fully pardoned.&nbsp; 
This the King very faithfully promised, but Robert was no sooner 
gone than he began to punish them.</p>
<p>Among them was the Earl of Shrewsbury, who, on being summoned 
by the King to answer to five-and-forty accusations, rode away to
one of his strong castles, shut himself up therein, called around
him his tenants and vassals, and fought for his liberty, but was 
defeated and banished.&nbsp; Robert, with all his faults, was so 
true to his word, that when he first heard of this nobleman 
having risen against his brother, he laid waste the Earl of 
Shrewsbury&rsquo;s estates in Normandy, to show the King that he 
would favour no breach of their treaty.&nbsp; Finding, on better 
information, afterwards, that the Earl&rsquo;s only crime was 
having been his friend, he came over to England, in his old 
thoughtless, warm-hearted way, to intercede with the King, and 
remind him of the solemn promise to pardon all his followers.</p>
<p>This confidence might have put the false King to the blush, 
but it did not.&nbsp; Pretending to be very friendly, he so 
surrounded his brother with spies and traps, that Robert, who was
quite in his power, had nothing for it but to renounce his 
pension and escape while he could.&nbsp; Getting home to 
Normandy, and understanding the King better now, he naturally 
allied himself with his old friend the Earl of Shrewsbury, who 
had still thirty castles in that country.&nbsp; This was exactly 
what Henry wanted.&nbsp; He immediately declared that Robert had 
broken the treaty, and next year invaded Normandy.</p>
<p>He pretended that he came to deliver the Normans, at their own
request, from his brother&rsquo;s misrule.&nbsp; There is reason 
to fear that his misrule was bad enough; for his beautiful wife 
had died, leaving him with an infant son, and his court was again
so careless, dissipated, and ill-regulated, that it was said he 
sometimes lay in bed of a day for want of clothes to put 
on&mdash;his attendants having stolen all his dresses.&nbsp; But 
he headed his army like a brave prince and a gallant soldier, 
though he had the misfortune to be taken prisoner by King Henry, 
with four hundred of his Knights.&nbsp; Among them was poor 
harmless Edgar Atheling, who loved Robert well.&nbsp; Edgar was 
not important enough to be severe with.&nbsp; The King afterwards
gave him a small pension, which he lived upon and died upon, in 
peace, among the quiet woods and fields of England.</p>
<p>And Robert&mdash;poor, kind, generous, wasteful, heedless 
Robert, with so many faults, and yet with virtues that might have
made a better and a happier man&mdash;what was the end of 
him?&nbsp; If the King had had the magnanimity to say with a kind
air, &lsquo;Brother, tell me, before these noblemen, that from 
this time you will be my faithful follower and friend, and never 
raise your hand against me or my forces more!&rsquo; he might 
have trusted Robert to the death.&nbsp; But the King was not a 
magnanimous man.&nbsp; He sentenced his brother to be confined 
for life in one of the Royal Castles.&nbsp; In the beginning of 
his imprisonment, he was allowed to ride out, guarded; but he one
day broke away from his guard and galloped of.&nbsp; He had the 
evil fortune to ride into a swamp, where his horse stuck fast and
he was taken.&nbsp; When the King heard of it he ordered him to 
be blinded, which was done by putting a red-hot metal basin on 
his eyes.</p>
<p>And so, in darkness and in prison, many years, he thought of 
all his past life, of the time he had wasted, of the treasure he 
had squandered, of the opportunities he had lost, of the youth he
had thrown away, of the talents he had neglected.&nbsp; 
Sometimes, on fine autumn mornings, he would sit and think of the
old hunting parties in the free Forest, where he had been the 
foremost and the gayest.&nbsp; Sometimes, in the still nights, he
would wake, and mourn for the many nights that had stolen past 
him at the gaming-table; sometimes, would seem to hear, upon the 
melancholy wind, the old songs of the minstrels; sometimes, would
dream, in his blindness, of the light and glitter of the Norman 
Court.&nbsp; Many and many a time, he groped back, in his fancy, 
to Jerusalem, where he had fought so well; or, at the head of his
brave companions, bowed his feathered helmet to the shouts of 
welcome greeting him in Italy, and seemed again to walk among the
sunny vineyards, or on the shore of the blue sea, with his lovely
wife.&nbsp; And then, thinking of her grave, and of his 
fatherless boy, he would stretch out his solitary arms and 
weep.</p>
<p>At length, one day, there lay in prison, dead, with cruel and 
disfiguring scars upon his eyelids, bandaged from his 
jailer&rsquo;s sight, but on which the eternal Heavens looked 
down, a worn old man of eighty.&nbsp; He had once been Robert of 
Normandy.&nbsp; Pity him!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>At the time when Robert of Normandy was taken prisoner by his 
brother, Robert&rsquo;s little son was only five years old.&nbsp;
This child was taken, too, and carried before the King, sobbing 
and crying; for, young as he was, he knew he had good reason to 
be afraid of his Royal uncle.&nbsp; The King was not much 
accustomed to pity those who were in his power, but his cold 
heart seemed for the moment to soften towards the boy.&nbsp; He 
was observed to make a great effort, as if to prevent himself 
from being cruel, and ordered the child to be taken away; 
whereupon a certain Baron, who had married a daughter of Duke 
Robert&rsquo;s (by name, Helie of Saint Saen), took charge of 
him, tenderly.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s gentleness did not last 
long.&nbsp; Before two years were over, he sent messengers to 
this lord&rsquo;s Castle to seize the child and bring him 
away.&nbsp; The Baron was not there at the time, but his servants
were faithful, and carried the boy off in his sleep and hid 
him.&nbsp; When the Baron came home, and was told what the King 
had done, he took the child abroad, and, leading him by the hand,
went from King to King and from Court to Court, relating how the 
child had a claim to the throne of England, and how his uncle the
King, knowing that he had that claim, would have murdered him, 
perhaps, but for his escape.</p>
<p>The youth and innocence of the pretty little <span 
class="smcap">William Fitz-Robert</span> (for that was his name) 
made him many friends at that time.&nbsp; When he became a young 
man, the King of France, uniting with the French Counts of Anjou 
and Flanders, supported his cause against the King of England, 
and took many of the King&rsquo;s towns and castles in 
Normandy.&nbsp; But, King Henry, artful and cunning always, 
bribed some of William&rsquo;s friends with money, some with 
promises, some with power.&nbsp; He bought off the Count of 
Anjou, by promising to marry his eldest son, also named <span 
class="smcap">William</span>, to the Count&rsquo;s daughter; and 
indeed the whole trust of this King&rsquo;s life was in such 
bargains, and he believed (as many another King has done since, 
and as one King did in France a very little time ago) that every 
man&rsquo;s truth and honour can be bought at some price.&nbsp; 
For all this, he was so afraid of William Fitz-Robert and his 
friends, that, for a long time, he believed his life to be in 
danger; and never lay down to sleep, even in his palace 
surrounded by his guards, without having a sword and buckler at 
his bedside.</p>
<p>To strengthen his power, the King with great ceremony 
betrothed his eldest daughter <span class="smcap">Matilda</span>,
then a child only eight years old, to be the wife of Henry the 
Fifth, the Emperor of Germany.&nbsp; To raise her 
marriage-portion, he taxed the English people in a most 
oppressive manner; then treated them to a great procession, to 
restore their good humour; and sent Matilda away, in fine state, 
with the German ambassadors, to be educated in the country of her
future husband.</p>
<p>And now his Queen, Maud the Good, unhappily died.&nbsp; It was
a sad thought for that gentle lady, that the only hope with which
she had married a man whom she had never loved&mdash;the hope of 
reconciling the Norman and English races&mdash;had failed.&nbsp; 
At the very time of her death, Normandy and all France was in 
arms against England; for, so soon as his last danger was over, 
King Henry had been false to all the French powers he had 
promised, bribed, and bought, and they had naturally united 
against him.&nbsp; After some fighting, however, in which few 
suffered but the unhappy common people (who always suffered, 
whatsoever was the matter), he began to promise, bribe, and buy 
again; and by those means, and by the help of the Pope, who 
exerted himself to save more bloodshed, and by solemnly 
declaring, over and over again, that he really was in earnest 
this time, and would keep his word, the King made peace.</p>
<p>One of the first consequences of this peace was, that the King
went over to Normandy with his son Prince William and a great 
retinue, to have the Prince acknowledged as his successor by the 
Norman Nobles, and to contract the promised marriage (this was 
one of the many promises the King had broken) between him and the
daughter of the Count of Anjou.&nbsp; Both these things were 
triumphantly done, with great show and rejoicing; and on the 
twenty-fifth of November, in the year one thousand one hundred 
and twenty, the whole retinue prepared to embark at the Port of 
Barfleur, for the voyage home.</p>
<p>On that day, and at that place, there came to the King, 
Fitz-Stephen, a sea-captain, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My liege, my father served your father all his life, 
upon the sea.&nbsp; He steered the ship with the golden boy upon 
the prow, in which your father sailed to conquer England.&nbsp; I
beseech you to grant me the same office.&nbsp; I have a fair 
vessel in the harbour here, called The White Ship, manned by 
fifty sailors of renown.&nbsp; I pray you, Sire, to let your 
servant have the honour of steering you in The White Ship to 
England!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry, friend,&rsquo; replied the King, 
&lsquo;that my vessel is already chosen, and that I cannot 
(therefore) sail with the son of the man who served my 
father.&nbsp; But the Prince and all his company shall go along 
with you, in the fair White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors of 
renown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An hour or two afterwards, the King set sail in the vessel he 
had chosen, accompanied by other vessels, and, sailing all night 
with a fair and gentle wind, arrived upon the coast of England in
the morning.&nbsp; While it was yet night, the people in some of 
those ships heard a faint wild cry come over the sea, and 
wondered what it was.</p>
<p>Now, the Prince was a dissolute, debauched young man of 
eighteen, who bore no love to the English, and had declared that 
when he came to the throne he would yoke them to the plough like 
oxen.&nbsp; He went aboard The White Ship, with one hundred and 
forty youthful Nobles like himself, among whom were eighteen 
noble ladies of the highest rank.&nbsp; All this gay company, 
with their servants and the fifty sailors, made three hundred 
souls aboard the fair White Ship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,&rsquo; said the
Prince, &lsquo;to the fifty sailors of renown!&nbsp; My father 
the King has sailed out of the harbour.&nbsp; What time is there 
to make merry here, and yet reach England with the 
rest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prince!&rsquo; said Fitz-Stephen, &lsquo;before 
morning, my fifty and The White Ship shall overtake the swiftest 
vessel in attendance on your father the King, if we sail at 
midnight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince commanded to make merry; and the sailors drank
out the three casks of wine; and the Prince and all the noble 
company danced in the moonlight on the deck of The White 
Ship.</p>
<p>When, at last, she shot out of the harbour of Barfleur, there 
was not a sober seaman on board.&nbsp; But the sails were all 
set, and the oars all going merrily.&nbsp; Fitz-Stephen had the 
helm.&nbsp; The gay young nobles and the beautiful ladies, 
wrapped in mantles of various bright colours to protect them from
the cold, talked, laughed, and sang.&nbsp; The Prince encouraged 
the fifty sailors to row harder yet, for the honour of The White 
Ship.</p>
<p>Crash!&nbsp; A terrific cry broke from three hundred 
hearts.&nbsp; It was the cry the people in the distant vessels of
the King heard faintly on the water.&nbsp; The White Ship had 
struck upon a rock&mdash;was filling&mdash;going down!</p>
<p>Fitz-Stephen hurried the Prince into a boat, with some few 
Nobles.&nbsp; &lsquo;Push off,&rsquo; he whispered; &lsquo;and 
row to land.&nbsp; It is not far, and the sea is smooth.&nbsp; 
The rest of us must die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, as they rowed away, fast, from the sinking ship, the 
Prince heard the voice of his sister <span 
class="smcap">Marie</span>, the Countess of Perche, calling for 
help.&nbsp; He never in his life had been so good as he was 
then.&nbsp; He cried in an agony, &lsquo;Row back at any 
risk!&nbsp; I cannot bear to leave her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They rowed back.&nbsp; As the Prince held out his arms to 
catch his sister, such numbers leaped in, that the boat was 
overset.&nbsp; And in the same instant The White Ship went 
down.</p>
<p>Only two men floated.&nbsp; They both clung to the main yard 
of the ship, which had broken from the mast, and now supported 
them.&nbsp; One asked the other who he was?&nbsp; He said, 
&lsquo;I am a nobleman, <span class="smcap">Godfrey</span> by 
name, the son of <span class="smcap">Gilbert de 
l&rsquo;Aigle</span>.&nbsp; And you?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I am <span class="smcap">Berold</span>, a poor butcher of 
Rouen,&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp; Then, they said together, 
&lsquo;Lord be merciful to us both!&rsquo; and tried to encourage
one another, as they drifted in the cold benumbing sea on that 
unfortunate November night.</p>
<p>By-and-by, another man came swimming towards them, whom they 
knew, when he pushed aside his long wet hair, to be 
Fitz-Stephen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is the Prince?&rsquo; said 
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gone! Gone!&rsquo; the two cried together.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Neither he, nor his brother, nor his sister, nor the 
King&rsquo;s niece, nor her brother, nor any one of all the brave
three hundred, noble or commoner, except we three, has risen 
above the water!&rsquo;&nbsp; Fitz-Stephen, with a ghastly face, 
cried, &lsquo;Woe! woe, to me!&rsquo; and sunk to the bottom.</p>
<p>The other two clung to the yard for some hours.&nbsp; At 
length the young noble said faintly, &lsquo;I am exhausted, and 
chilled with the cold, and can hold no longer.&nbsp; Farewell, 
good friend!&nbsp; God preserve you!&rsquo;&nbsp; So, he dropped 
and sunk; and of all the brilliant crowd, the poor Butcher of 
Rouen alone was saved.&nbsp; In the morning, some fishermen saw 
him floating in his sheep-skin coat, and got him into their 
boat&mdash;the sole relater of the dismal tale.</p>
<p>For three days, no one dared to carry the intelligence to the 
King.&nbsp; At length, they sent into his presence a little boy, 
who, weeping bitterly, and kneeling at his feet, told him that 
The White Ship was lost with all on board.&nbsp; The King fell to
the ground like a dead man, and never, never afterwards, was seen
to smile.</p>
<p>But he plotted again, and promised again, and bribed and 
bought again, in his old deceitful way.&nbsp; Having no son to 
succeed him, after all his pains (&lsquo;The Prince will never 
yoke us to the plough, now!&rsquo; said the English people), he 
took a second wife&mdash;<span class="smcap">Adelais</span> or 
<span class="smcap">Alice</span>, a duke&rsquo;s daughter, and 
the Pope&rsquo;s niece.&nbsp; Having no more children, however, 
he proposed to the Barons to swear that they would recognise as 
his successor, his daughter Matilda, whom, as she was now a 
widow, he married to the eldest son of the Count of Anjou, <span 
class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>, surnamed <span 
class="smcap">Plantagenet</span>, from a custom he had of wearing
a sprig of flowering broom (called Gen&ecirc;t in French) in his 
cap for a feather.&nbsp; As one false man usually makes many, and
as a false King, in particular, is pretty certain to make a false
Court, the Barons took the oath about the succession of Matilda 
(and her children after her), twice over, without in the least 
intending to keep it.&nbsp; The King was now relieved from any 
remaining fears of William Fitz-Robert, by his death in the 
Monastery of St. Omer, in France, at twenty-six years old, of a 
pike-wound in the hand.&nbsp; And as Matilda gave birth to three 
sons, he thought the succession to the throne secure.</p>
<p>He spent most of the latter part of his life, which was 
troubled by family quarrels, in Normandy, to be near 
Matilda.&nbsp; When he had reigned upward of thirty-five years, 
and was sixty-seven years old, he died of an indigestion and 
fever, brought on by eating, when he was far from well, of a fish
called Lamprey, against which he had often been cautioned by his 
physicians.&nbsp; His remains were brought over to Reading Abbey 
to be buried.</p>
<p>You may perhaps hear the cunning and promise-breaking of King 
Henry the First, called &lsquo;policy&rsquo; by some people, and 
&lsquo;diplomacy&rsquo; by others.&nbsp; Neither of these fine 
words will in the least mean that it was true; and nothing that 
is not true can possibly be good.</p>
<p>His greatest merit, that I know of, was his love of 
learning&mdash;I should have given him greater credit even for 
that, if it had been strong enough to induce him to spare the 
eyes of a certain poet he once took prisoner, who was a knight 
besides.&nbsp; But he ordered the poet&rsquo;s eyes to be torn 
from his head, because he had laughed at him in his verses; and 
the poet, in the pain of that torture, dashed out his own brains 
against his prison wall.&nbsp; King Henry the First was 
avaricious, revengeful, and so false, that I suppose a man never 
lived whose word was less to be relied upon.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER MATILDA AND STEPHEN</h2>
<p>The King was no sooner dead than all the plans and schemes he 
had laboured at so long, and lied so much for, crumbled away like
a hollow heap of sand.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, 
whom he had never mistrusted or suspected, started up to claim 
the throne.</p>
<p>Stephen was the son of <span class="smcap">Adela</span>, the 
Conqueror&rsquo;s daughter, married to the Count of Blois.&nbsp; 
To Stephen, and to his brother <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, 
the late King had been liberal; making Henry Bishop of 
Winchester, and finding a good marriage for Stephen, and much 
enriching him.&nbsp; This did not prevent Stephen from hastily 
producing a false witness, a servant of the late King, to swear 
that the King had named him for his heir upon his 
death-bed.&nbsp; On this evidence the Archbishop of Canterbury 
crowned him.&nbsp; The new King, so suddenly made, lost not a 
moment in seizing the Royal treasure, and hiring foreign soldiers
with some of it to protect his throne.</p>
<p>If the dead King had even done as the false witness said, he 
would have had small right to will away the English people, like 
so many sheep or oxen, without their consent.&nbsp; But he had, 
in fact, bequeathed all his territory to Matilda; who, supported 
by <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, Earl of Gloucester, soon 
began to dispute the crown.&nbsp; Some of the powerful barons and
priests took her side; some took Stephen&rsquo;s; all fortified 
their castles; and again the miserable English people were 
involved in war, from which they could never derive advantage 
whosoever was victorious, and in which all parties plundered, 
tortured, starved, and ruined them.</p>
<p>Five years had passed since the death of Henry the 
First&mdash;and during those five years there had been two 
terrible invasions by the people of Scotland under their King, 
David, who was at last defeated with all his army&mdash;when 
Matilda, attended by her brother Robert and a large force, 
appeared in England to maintain her claim.&nbsp; A battle was 
fought between her troops and King Stephen&rsquo;s at Lincoln; in
which the King himself was taken prisoner, after bravely fighting
until his battle-axe and sword were broken, and was carried into 
strict confinement at Gloucester.&nbsp; Matilda then submitted 
herself to the Priests, and the Priests crowned her Queen of 
England.</p>
<p>She did not long enjoy this dignity.&nbsp; The people of 
London had a great affection for Stephen; many of the Barons 
considered it degrading to be ruled by a woman; and the 
Queen&rsquo;s temper was so haughty that she made innumerable 
enemies.&nbsp; The people of London revolted; and, in alliance 
with the troops of Stephen, besieged her at Winchester, where 
they took her brother Robert prisoner, whom, as her best soldier 
and chief general, she was glad to exchange for Stephen himself, 
who thus regained his liberty.&nbsp; Then, the long war went on 
afresh.&nbsp; Once, she was pressed so hard in the Castle of 
Oxford, in the winter weather when the snow lay thick upon the 
ground, that her only chance of escape was to dress herself all 
in white, and, accompanied by no more than three faithful 
Knights, dressed in like manner that their figures might not be 
seen from Stephen&rsquo;s camp as they passed over the snow, to 
steal away on foot, cross the frozen Thames, walk a long 
distance, and at last gallop away on horseback.&nbsp; All this 
she did, but to no great purpose then; for her brother dying 
while the struggle was yet going on, she at last withdrew to 
Normandy.</p>
<p>In two or three years after her withdrawal her cause appeared 
in England, afresh, in the person of her son Henry, young 
Plantagenet, who, at only eighteen years of age, was very 
powerful: not only on account of his mother having resigned all 
Normandy to him, but also from his having married <span 
class="smcap">Eleanor</span>, the divorced wife of the French 
King, a bad woman, who had great possessions in France.&nbsp; 
Louis, the French King, not relishing this arrangement, helped 
<span class="smcap">Eustace</span>, King Stephen&rsquo;s son, to 
invade Normandy: but Henry drove their united forces out of that 
country, and then returned here, to assist his partisans, whom 
the King was then besieging at Wallingford upon the Thames.&nbsp;
Here, for two days, divided only by the river, the two armies lay
encamped opposite to one another&mdash;on the eve, as it seemed 
to all men, of another desperate fight, when the <span 
class="smcap">Earl of Arundel</span> took heart and said 
&lsquo;that it was not reasonable to prolong the unspeakable 
miseries of two kingdoms to minister to the ambition of two 
princes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many other noblemen repeating and supporting this when it was 
once uttered, Stephen and young Plantagenet went down, each to 
his own bank of the river, and held a conversation across it, in 
which they arranged a truce; very much to the dissatisfaction of 
Eustace, who swaggered away with some followers, and laid violent
hands on the Abbey of St. Edmund&rsquo;s-Bury, where he presently
died mad.&nbsp; The truce led to a solemn council at Winchester, 
in which it was agreed that Stephen should retain the crown, on 
condition of his declaring Henry his successor; that <span 
class="smcap">William</span>, another son of the King&rsquo;s, 
should inherit his father&rsquo;s rightful possessions; and that 
all the Crown lands which Stephen had given away should be 
recalled, and all the Castles he had permitted to be built 
demolished.&nbsp; Thus terminated the bitter war, which had now 
lasted fifteen years, and had again laid England waste.&nbsp; In 
the next year <span class="smcap">Stephen</span> died, after a 
troubled reign of nineteen years.</p>
<p>Although King Stephen was, for the time in which he lived, a 
humane and moderate man, with many excellent qualities; and 
although nothing worse is known of him than his usurpation of the
Crown, which he probably excused to himself by the consideration 
that King Henry the First was a usurper too&mdash;which was no 
excuse at all; the people of England suffered more in these dread
nineteen years, than at any former period even of their suffering
history.&nbsp; In the division of the nobility between the two 
rival claimants of the Crown, and in the growth of what is called
the Feudal System (which made the peasants the born vassals and 
mere slaves of the Barons), every Noble had his strong Castle, 
where he reigned the cruel king of all the neighbouring 
people.&nbsp; Accordingly, he perpetrated whatever cruelties he 
chose.&nbsp; And never were worse cruelties committed upon earth 
than in wretched England in those nineteen years.</p>
<p>The writers who were living then describe them 
fearfully.&nbsp; They say that the castles were filled with 
devils rather than with men; that the peasants, men and women, 
were put into dungeons for their gold and silver, were tortured 
with fire and smoke, were hung up by the thumbs, were hung up by 
the heels with great weights to their heads, were torn with 
jagged irons, killed with hunger, broken to death in narrow 
chests filled with sharp-pointed stones, murdered in countless 
fiendish ways.&nbsp; In England there was no corn, no meat, no 
cheese, no butter, there were no tilled lands, no harvests.&nbsp;
Ashes of burnt towns, and dreary wastes, were all that the 
traveller, fearful of the robbers who prowled abroad at all 
hours, would see in a long day&rsquo;s journey; and from sunrise 
until night, he would not come upon a home.</p>
<p>The clergy sometimes suffered, and heavily too, from pillage, 
but many of them had castles of their own, and fought in helmet 
and armour like the barons, and drew lots with other fighting men
for their share of booty.&nbsp; The Pope (or Bishop of Rome), on 
King Stephen&rsquo;s resisting his ambition, laid England under 
an Interdict at one period of this reign; which means that he 
allowed no service to be performed in the churches, no couples to
be married, no bells to be rung, no dead bodies to be 
buried.&nbsp; Any man having the power to refuse these things, no
matter whether he were called a Pope or a Poulterer, would, of 
course, have the power of afflicting numbers of innocent 
people.&nbsp; That nothing might be wanting to the miseries of 
King Stephen&rsquo;s time, the Pope threw in this contribution to
the public store&mdash;not very like the widow&rsquo;s 
contribution, as I think, when Our Saviour sat in Jerusalem 
over-against the Treasury, &lsquo;and she threw in two mites, 
which make a farthing.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SECOND</h2>
<h3>PART THE FIRST</h3>
<p>Henry Plantagenet, when he was but twenty-one years old, 
quietly succeeded to the throne of England, according to his 
agreement made with the late King at Winchester.&nbsp; Six weeks 
after Stephen&rsquo;s death, he and his Queen, Eleanor, were 
crowned in that city; into which they rode on horseback in great 
state, side by side, amidst much shouting and rejoicing, and 
clashing of music, and strewing of flowers.</p>
<p>The reign of King Henry the Second began well.&nbsp; The King 
had great possessions, and (what with his own rights, and what 
with those of his wife) was lord of one-third part of 
France.&nbsp; He was a young man of vigour, ability, and 
resolution, and immediately applied himself to remove some of the
evils which had arisen in the last unhappy reign.&nbsp; He 
revoked all the grants of land that had been hastily made, on 
either side, during the late struggles; he obliged numbers of 
disorderly soldiers to depart from England; he reclaimed all the 
castles belonging to the Crown; and he forced the wicked nobles 
to pull down their own castles, to the number of eleven hundred, 
in which such dismal cruelties had been inflicted on the 
people.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s brother, <span 
class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>, rose against him in France, while 
he was so well employed, and rendered it necessary for him to 
repair to that country; where, after he had subdued and made a 
friendly arrangement with his brother (who did not live long), 
his ambition to increase his possessions involved him in a war 
with the French King, Louis, with whom he had been on such 
friendly terms just before, that to the French King&rsquo;s 
infant daughter, then a baby in the cradle, he had promised one 
of his little sons in marriage, who was a child of five years 
old.&nbsp; However, the war came to nothing at last, and the Pope
made the two Kings friends again.</p>
<p>Now, the clergy, in the troubles of the last reign, had gone 
on very ill indeed.&nbsp; There were all kinds of criminals among
them&mdash;murderers, thieves, and vagabonds; and the worst of 
the matter was, that the good priests would not give up the bad 
priests to justice, when they committed crimes, but persisted in 
sheltering and defending them.&nbsp; The King, well knowing that 
there could be no peace or rest in England while such things 
lasted, resolved to reduce the power of the clergy; and, when he 
had reigned seven years, found (as he considered) a good 
opportunity for doing so, in the death of the Archbishop of 
Canterbury.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will have for the new 
Archbishop,&rsquo; thought the King, &lsquo;a friend in whom I 
can trust, who will help me to humble these rebellious priests, 
and to have them dealt with, when they do wrong, as other men who
do wrong are dealt with.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, he resolved to make his
favourite, the new Archbishop; and this favourite was so 
extraordinary a man, and his story is so curious, that I must 
tell you all about him.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a worthy merchant of London, named <span 
class="smcap">Gilbert &agrave; Becket</span>, made a pilgrimage 
to the Holy Land, and was taken prisoner by a Saracen lord.&nbsp;
This lord, who treated him kindly and not like a slave, had one 
fair daughter, who fell in love with the merchant; and who told 
him that she wanted to become a Christian, and was willing to 
marry him if they could fly to a Christian country.&nbsp; The 
merchant returned her love, until he found an opportunity to 
escape, when he did not trouble himself about the Saracen lady, 
but escaped with his servant Richard, who had been taken prisoner
along with him, and arrived in England and forgot her.&nbsp; The 
Saracen lady, who was more loving than the merchant, left her 
father&rsquo;s house in disguise to follow him, and made her way,
under many hardships, to the sea-shore.&nbsp; The merchant had 
taught her only two English words (for I suppose he must have 
learnt the Saracen tongue himself, and made love in that 
language), of which <span class="smcap">London</span> was one, 
and his own name, <span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>, the 
other.&nbsp; She went among the ships, saying, &lsquo;London! 
London!&rsquo; over and over again, until the sailors understood 
that she wanted to find an English vessel that would carry her 
there; so they showed her such a ship, and she paid for her 
passage with some of her jewels, and sailed away.&nbsp; 
Well!&nbsp; The merchant was sitting in his counting-house in 
London one day, when he heard a great noise in the street; and 
presently Richard came running in from the warehouse, with his 
eyes wide open and his breath almost gone, saying, &lsquo;Master,
master, here is the Saracen lady!&rsquo;&nbsp; The merchant 
thought Richard was mad; but Richard said, &lsquo;No, 
master!&nbsp; As I live, the Saracen lady is going up and down 
the city, calling Gilbert!&nbsp; Gilbert!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, he 
took the merchant by the sleeve, and pointed out of window; and 
there they saw her among the gables and water-spouts of the dark,
dirty street, in her foreign dress, so forlorn, surrounded by a 
wondering crowd, and passing slowly along, calling Gilbert, 
Gilbert!&nbsp; When the merchant saw her, and thought of the 
tenderness she had shown him in his captivity, and of her 
constancy, his heart was moved, and he ran down into the street; 
and she saw him coming, and with a great cry fainted in his 
arms.&nbsp; They were married without loss of time, and Richard 
(who was an excellent man) danced with joy the whole day of the 
wedding; and they all lived happy ever afterwards.</p>
<p>This merchant and this Saracen lady had one son, <span 
class="smcap">Thomas &agrave; Becket</span>.&nbsp; He it was who 
became the Favourite of King Henry the Second.</p>
<p>He had become Chancellor, when the King thought of making him 
Archbishop.&nbsp; He was clever, gay, well educated, brave; had 
fought in several battles in France; had defeated a French knight
in single combat, and brought his horse away as a token of the 
victory.&nbsp; He lived in a noble palace, he was the tutor of 
the young Prince Henry, he was served by one hundred and forty 
knights, his riches were immense.&nbsp; The King once sent him as
his ambassador to France; and the French people, beholding in 
what state he travelled, cried out in the streets, &lsquo;How 
splendid must the King of England be, when this is only the 
Chancellor!&rsquo;&nbsp; They had good reason to wonder at the 
magnificence of Thomas &agrave; Becket, for, when he entered a 
French town, his procession was headed by two hundred and fifty 
singing boys; then, came his hounds in couples; then, eight 
waggons, each drawn by five horses driven by five drivers: two of
the waggons filled with strong ale to be given away to the 
people; four, with his gold and silver plate and stately clothes;
two, with the dresses of his numerous servants.&nbsp; Then, came 
twelve horses, each with a monkey on his back; then, a train of 
people bearing shields and leading fine war-horses splendidly 
equipped; then, falconers with hawks upon their wrists; then, a 
host of knights, and gentlemen and priests; then, the Chancellor 
with his brilliant garments flashing in the sun, and all the 
people capering and shouting with delight.</p>
<p>The King was well pleased with all this, thinking that it only
made himself the more magnificent to have so magnificent a 
favourite; but he sometimes jested with the Chancellor upon his 
splendour too.&nbsp; Once, when they were riding together through
the streets of London in hard winter weather, they saw a 
shivering old man in rags.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at the poor 
object!&rsquo; said the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would it not be a 
charitable act to give that aged man a comfortable warm 
cloak?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Undoubtedly it would,&rsquo; said 
Thomas &agrave; Becket, &lsquo;and you do well, Sir, to think of 
such Christian duties.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; cried the
King, &lsquo;then give him your cloak!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was made 
of rich crimson trimmed with ermine.&nbsp; The King tried to pull
it off, the Chancellor tried to keep it on, both were near 
rolling from their saddles in the mud, when the Chancellor 
submitted, and the King gave the cloak to the old beggar: much to
the beggar&rsquo;s astonishment, and much to the merriment of all
the courtiers in attendance.&nbsp; For, courtiers are not only 
eager to laugh when the King laughs, but they really do enjoy a 
laugh against a Favourite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will make,&rsquo; thought King Henry the second, 
&lsquo;this Chancellor of mine, Thomas &agrave; Becket, 
Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; He will then be the head of the 
Church, and, being devoted to me, will help me to correct the 
Church.&nbsp; He has always upheld my power against the power of 
the clergy, and once publicly told some bishops (I remember), 
that men of the Church were equally bound to me, with men of the 
sword.&nbsp; Thomas &agrave; Becket is the man, of all other men 
in England, to help me in my great design.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the 
King, regardless of all objection, either that he was a fighting 
man, or a lavish man, or a courtly man, or a man of pleasure, or 
anything but a likely man for the office, made him Archbishop 
accordingly.</p>
<p>Now, Thomas &agrave; Becket was proud and loved to be 
famous.&nbsp; He was already famous for the pomp of his life, for
his riches, his gold and silver plate, his waggons, horses, and 
attendants.&nbsp; He could do no more in that way than he had 
done; and being tired of that kind of fame (which is a very poor 
one), he longed to have his name celebrated for something 
else.&nbsp; Nothing, he knew, would render him so famous in the 
world, as the setting of his utmost power and ability against the
utmost power and ability of the King.&nbsp; He resolved with the 
whole strength of his mind to do it.</p>
<p>He may have had some secret grudge against the King 
besides.&nbsp; The King may have offended his proud humour at 
some time or other, for anything I know.&nbsp; I think it likely,
because it is a common thing for Kings, Princes, and other great 
people, to try the tempers of their favourites rather 
severely.&nbsp; Even the little affair of the crimson cloak must 
have been anything but a pleasant one to a haughty man.&nbsp; 
Thomas &agrave; Becket knew better than any one in England what 
the King expected of him.&nbsp; In all his sumptuous life, he had
never yet been in a position to disappoint the King.&nbsp; He 
could take up that proud stand now, as head of the Church; and he
determined that it should be written in history, either that he 
subdued the King, or that the King subdued him.</p>
<p>So, of a sudden, he completely altered the whole manner of his
life.&nbsp; He turned off all his brilliant followers, ate coarse
food, drank bitter water, wore next his skin sackcloth covered 
with dirt and vermin (for it was then thought very religious to 
be very dirty), flogged his back to punish himself, lived chiefly
in a little cell, washed the feet of thirteen poor people every 
day, and looked as miserable as he possibly could.&nbsp; If he 
had put twelve hundred monkeys on horseback instead of twelve, 
and had gone in procession with eight thousand waggons instead of
eight, he could not have half astonished the people so much as by
this great change.&nbsp; It soon caused him to be more talked 
about as an Archbishop than he had been as a Chancellor.</p>
<p>The King was very angry; and was made still more so, when the 
new Archbishop, claiming various estates from the nobles as being
rightfully Church property, required the King himself, for the 
same reason, to give up Rochester Castle, and Rochester City 
too.&nbsp; Not satisfied with this, he declared that no power but
himself should appoint a priest to any Church in the part of 
England over which he was Archbishop; and when a certain 
gentleman of Kent made such an appointment, as he claimed to have
the right to do, Thomas &agrave; Becket excommunicated him.</p>
<p>Excommunication was, next to the Interdict I told you of at 
the close of the last chapter, the great weapon of the 
clergy.&nbsp; It consisted in declaring the person who was 
excommunicated, an outcast from the Church and from all religious
offices; and in cursing him all over, from the top of his head to
the sole of his foot, whether he was standing up, lying down, 
sitting, kneeling, walking, running, hopping, jumping, gaping, 
coughing, sneezing, or whatever else he was doing.&nbsp; This 
unchristian nonsense would of course have made no sort of 
difference to the person cursed&mdash;who could say his prayers 
at home if he were shut out of church, and whom none but <span 
class="smcap">God</span> could judge&mdash;but for the fears and 
superstitions of the people, who avoided excommunicated persons, 
and made their lives unhappy.&nbsp; So, the King said to the New 
Archbishop, &lsquo;Take off this Excommunication from this 
gentleman of Kent.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which the Archbishop replied, 
&lsquo;I shall do no such thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The quarrel went on.&nbsp; A priest in Worcestershire 
committed a most dreadful murder, that aroused the horror of the 
whole nation.&nbsp; The King demanded to have this wretch 
delivered up, to be tried in the same court and in the same way 
as any other murderer.&nbsp; The Archbishop refused, and kept him
in the Bishop&rsquo;s prison.&nbsp; The King, holding a solemn 
assembly in Westminster Hall, demanded that in future all priests
found guilty before their Bishops of crimes against the law of 
the land should be considered priests no longer, and should be 
delivered over to the law of the land for punishment.&nbsp; The 
Archbishop again refused.&nbsp; The King required to know whether
the clergy would obey the ancient customs of the country?&nbsp; 
Every priest there, but one, said, after Thomas &agrave; Becket, 
&lsquo;Saving my order.&rsquo;&nbsp; This really meant that they 
would only obey those customs when they did not interfere with 
their own claims; and the King went out of the Hall in great 
wrath.</p>
<p>Some of the clergy began to be afraid, now, that they were 
going too far.&nbsp; Though Thomas &agrave; Becket was otherwise 
as unmoved as Westminster Hall, they prevailed upon him, for the 
sake of their fears, to go to the King at Woodstock, and promise 
to observe the ancient customs of the country, without saying 
anything about his order.&nbsp; The King received this submission
favourably, and summoned a great council of the clergy to meet at
the Castle of Clarendon, by Salisbury.&nbsp; But when the council
met, the Archbishop again insisted on the words &lsquo;saying my 
order;&rsquo; and he still insisted, though lords entreated him, 
and priests wept before him and knelt to him, and an adjoining 
room was thrown open, filled with armed soldiers of the King, to 
threaten him.&nbsp; At length he gave way, for that time, and the
ancient customs (which included what the King had demanded in 
vain) were stated in writing, and were signed and sealed by the 
chief of the clergy, and were called the Constitutions of 
Clarendon.</p>
<p>The quarrel went on, for all that.&nbsp; The Archbishop tried 
to see the King.&nbsp; The King would not see him.&nbsp; The 
Archbishop tried to escape from England.&nbsp; The sailors on the
coast would launch no boat to take him away.&nbsp; Then, he again
resolved to do his worst in opposition to the King, and began 
openly to set the ancient customs at defiance.</p>
<p>The King summoned him before a great council at Northampton, 
where he accused him of high treason, and made a claim against 
him, which was not a just one, for an enormous sum of 
money.&nbsp; Thomas &agrave; Becket was alone against the whole 
assembly, and the very Bishops advised him to resign his office 
and abandon his contest with the King.&nbsp; His great anxiety 
and agitation stretched him on a sick-bed for two days, but he 
was still undaunted.&nbsp; He went to the adjourned council, 
carrying a great cross in his right hand, and sat down holding it
erect before him.&nbsp; The King angrily retired into an inner 
room.&nbsp; The whole assembly angrily retired and left him 
there.&nbsp; But there he sat.&nbsp; The Bishops came out again 
in a body, and renounced him as a traitor.&nbsp; He only said, 
&lsquo;I hear!&rsquo; and sat there still.&nbsp; They retired 
again into the inner room, and his trial proceeded without 
him.&nbsp; By-and-by, the Earl of Leicester, heading the barons, 
came out to read his sentence.&nbsp; He refused to hear it, 
denied the power of the court, and said he would refer his cause 
to the Pope.&nbsp; As he walked out of the hall, with the cross 
in his hand, some of those present picked up rushes&mdash;rushes 
were strewn upon the floors in those days by way of 
carpet&mdash;and threw them at him.&nbsp; He proudly turned his 
head, and said that were he not Archbishop, he would chastise 
those cowards with the sword he had known how to use in bygone 
days.&nbsp; He then mounted his horse, and rode away, cheered and
surrounded by the common people, to whom he threw open his house 
that night and gave a supper, supping with them himself.&nbsp; 
That same night he secretly departed from the town; and so, 
travelling by night and hiding by day, and calling himself 
&lsquo;Brother Dearman,&rsquo; got away, not without difficulty, 
to Flanders.</p>
<p>The struggle still went on.&nbsp; The angry King took 
possession of the revenues of the archbishopric, and banished all
the relations and servants of Thomas &agrave; Becket, to the 
number of four hundred.&nbsp; The Pope and the French King both 
protected him, and an abbey was assigned for his residence.&nbsp;
Stimulated by this support, Thomas &agrave; Becket, on a great 
festival day, formally proceeded to a great church crowded with 
people, and going up into the pulpit publicly cursed and 
excommunicated all who had supported the Constitutions of 
Clarendon: mentioning many English noblemen by name, and not 
distantly hinting at the King of England himself.</p>
<p>When intelligence of this new affront was carried to the King 
in his chamber, his passion was so furious that he tore his 
clothes, and rolled like a madman on his bed of straw and 
rushes.&nbsp; But he was soon up and doing.&nbsp; He ordered all 
the ports and coasts of England to be narrowly watched, that no 
letters of Interdict might be brought into the kingdom; and sent 
messengers and bribes to the Pope&rsquo;s palace at Rome.&nbsp; 
Meanwhile, Thomas &agrave; Becket, for his part, was not idle at 
Rome, but constantly employed his utmost arts in his own 
behalf.&nbsp; Thus the contest stood, until there was peace 
between France and England (which had been for some time at war),
and until the two children of the two Kings were married in 
celebration of it.&nbsp; Then, the French King brought about a 
meeting between Henry and his old favourite, so long his 
enemy.</p>
<p>Even then, though Thomas &agrave; Becket knelt before the 
King, he was obstinate and immovable as to those words about his 
order.&nbsp; King Louis of France was weak enough in his 
veneration for Thomas &agrave; Becket and such men, but this was 
a little too much for him.&nbsp; He said that &agrave; Becket 
&lsquo;wanted to be greater than the saints and better than St. 
Peter,&rsquo; and rode away from him with the King of 
England.&nbsp; His poor French Majesty asked &agrave; 
Becket&rsquo;s pardon for so doing, however, soon afterwards, and
cut a very pitiful figure.</p>
<p>At last, and after a world of trouble, it came to this.&nbsp; 
There was another meeting on French ground between King Henry and
Thomas &agrave; Becket, and it was agreed that Thomas &agrave; 
Becket should be Archbishop of Canterbury, according to the 
customs of former Archbishops, and that the King should put him 
in possession of the revenues of that post.&nbsp; And now, 
indeed, you might suppose the struggle at an end, and Thomas 
&agrave; Becket at rest.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">No</span>, not
even yet.&nbsp; For Thomas &agrave; Becket hearing, by some 
means, that King Henry, when he was in dread of his kingdom being
placed under an interdict, had had his eldest son Prince Henry 
secretly crowned, not only persuaded the Pope to suspend the 
Archbishop of York who had performed that ceremony, and to 
excommunicate the Bishops who had assisted at it, but sent a 
messenger of his own into England, in spite of all the 
King&rsquo;s precautions along the coast, who delivered the 
letters of excommunication into the Bishops&rsquo; own 
hands.&nbsp; Thomas &agrave; Becket then came over to England 
himself, after an absence of seven years.&nbsp; He was privately 
warned that it was dangerous to come, and that an ireful knight, 
named <span class="smcap">Ranulf de Broc</span>, had threatened 
that he should not live to eat a loaf of bread in England; but he
came.</p>
<p>The common people received him well, and marched about with 
him in a soldierly way, armed with such rustic weapons as they 
could get.&nbsp; He tried to see the young prince who had once 
been his pupil, but was prevented.&nbsp; He hoped for some little
support among the nobles and priests, but found none.&nbsp; He 
made the most of the peasants who attended him, and feasted them,
and went from Canterbury to Harrow-on-the-Hill, and from 
Harrow-on-the-Hill back to Canterbury, and on Christmas Day 
preached in the Cathedral there, and told the people in his 
sermon that he had come to die among them, and that it was likely
he would be murdered.&nbsp; He had no fear, however&mdash;or, if 
he had any, he had much more obstinacy&mdash;for he, then and 
there, excommunicated three of his enemies, of whom Ranulf de 
Broc, the ireful knight, was one.</p>
<p>As men in general had no fancy for being cursed, in their 
sitting and walking, and gaping and sneezing, and all the rest of
it, it was very natural in the persons so freely excommunicated 
to complain to the King.&nbsp; It was equally natural in the 
King, who had hoped that this troublesome opponent was at last 
quieted, to fall into a mighty rage when he heard of these new 
affronts; and, on the Archbishop of York telling him that he 
never could hope for rest while Thomas &agrave; Becket lived, to 
cry out hastily before his court, &lsquo;Have I no one here who 
will deliver me from this man?&rsquo;&nbsp; There were four 
knights present, who, hearing the King&rsquo;s words, looked at 
one another, and went out.</p>
<p>The names of these knights were <span class="smcap">Reginald 
Fitzurse</span>, <span class="smcap">William Tracy</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Hugh de Morville</span>, and <span 
class="smcap">Richard Brito</span>; three of whom had been in the
train of Thomas &agrave; Becket in the old days of his 
splendour.&nbsp; They rode away on horseback, in a very secret 
manner, and on the third day after Christmas Day arrived at 
Saltwood House, not far from Canterbury, which belonged to the 
family of Ranulf de Broc.&nbsp; They quietly collected some 
followers here, in case they should need any; and proceeding to 
Canterbury, suddenly appeared (the four knights and twelve men) 
before the Archbishop, in his own house, at two o&rsquo;clock in 
the afternoon.&nbsp; They neither bowed nor spoke, but sat down 
on the floor in silence, staring at the Archbishop.</p>
<p>Thomas &agrave; Becket said, at length, &lsquo;What do you 
want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We want,&rsquo; said Reginald Fitzurse, &lsquo;the 
excommunication taken from the Bishops, and you to answer for 
your offences to the King.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thomas &agrave; Becket 
defiantly replied, that the power of the clergy was above the 
power of the King.&nbsp; That it was not for such men as they 
were, to threaten him.&nbsp; That if he were threatened by all 
the swords in England, he would never yield.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we will do more than threaten!&rsquo; said the 
knights.&nbsp; And they went out with the twelve men, and put on 
their armour, and drew their shining swords, and came back.</p>
<p>His servants, in the meantime, had shut up and barred the 
great gate of the palace.&nbsp; At first, the knights tried to 
shatter it with their battle-axes; but, being shown a window by 
which they could enter, they let the gate alone, and climbed in 
that way.&nbsp; While they were battering at the door, the 
attendants of Thomas &agrave; Becket had implored him to take 
refuge in the Cathedral; in which, as a sanctuary or sacred 
place, they thought the knights would dare to do no violent 
deed.&nbsp; He told them, again and again, that he would not 
stir.&nbsp; Hearing the distant voices of the monks singing the 
evening service, however, he said it was now his duty to attend, 
and therefore, and for no other reason, he would go.</p>
<p>There was a near way between his Palace and the Cathedral, by 
some beautiful old cloisters which you may yet see.&nbsp; He went
into the Cathedral, without any hurry, and having the Cross 
carried before him as usual.&nbsp; When he was safely there, his 
servants would have fastened the door, but he said <span 
class="smcap">No</span>! it was the house of God and not a 
fortress.</p>
<p>As he spoke, the shadow of Reginald Fitzurse appeared in the 
Cathedral doorway, darkening the little light there was outside, 
on the dark winter evening.&nbsp; This knight said, in a strong 
voice, &lsquo;Follow me, loyal servants of the King!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The rattle of the armour of the other knights echoed through the 
Cathedral, as they came clashing in.</p>
<p>It was so dark, in the lofty aisles and among the stately 
pillars of the church, and there were so many hiding-places in 
the crypt below and in the narrow passages above, that Thomas 
&agrave; Becket might even at that pass have saved himself if he 
would.&nbsp; But he would not.&nbsp; He told the monks resolutely
that he would not.&nbsp; And though they all dispersed and left 
him there with no other follower than <span class="smcap">Edward 
Gryme</span>, his faithful cross-bearer, he was as firm then, as 
ever he had been in his life.</p>
<p>The knights came on, through the darkness, making a terrible 
noise with their armed tread upon the stone pavement of the 
church.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is the traitor?&rsquo; they cried 
out.&nbsp; He made no answer.&nbsp; But when they cried, 
&lsquo;Where is the Archbishop?&rsquo; he said proudly, &lsquo;I 
am here!&rsquo; and came out of the shade and stood before 
them.</p>
<p>The knights had no desire to kill him, if they could rid the 
King and themselves of him by any other means.&nbsp; They told 
him he must either fly or go with them.&nbsp; He said he would do
neither; and he threw William Tracy off with such force when he 
took hold of his sleeve, that Tracy reeled again.&nbsp; By his 
reproaches and his steadiness, he so incensed them, and 
exasperated their fierce humour, that Reginald Fitzurse, whom he 
called by an ill name, said, &lsquo;Then die!&rsquo; and struck 
at his head.&nbsp; But the faithful Edward Gryme put out his arm,
and there received the main force of the blow, so that it only 
made his master bleed.&nbsp; Another voice from among the knights
again called to Thomas &agrave; Becket to fly; but, with his 
blood running down his face, and his hands clasped, and his head 
bent, he commanded himself to God, and stood firm.&nbsp; Then 
they cruelly killed him close to the altar of St. Bennet; and his
body fell upon the pavement, which was dirtied with his blood and
brains.</p>
<p>It is an awful thing to think of the murdered mortal, who had 
so showered his curses about, lying, all disfigured, in the 
church, where a few lamps here and there were but red specks on a
pall of darkness; and to think of the guilty knights riding away 
on horseback, looking over their shoulders at the dim Cathedral, 
and remembering what they had left inside.</p>
<h3>PART THE SECOND</h3>
<p>When the King heard how Thomas &agrave; Becket had lost his 
life in Canterbury Cathedral, through the ferocity of the four 
Knights, he was filled with dismay.&nbsp; Some have supposed that
when the King spoke those hasty words, &lsquo;Have I no one here 
who will deliver me from this man?&rsquo; he wished, and meant 
&agrave; Becket to be slain.&nbsp; But few things are more 
unlikely; for, besides that the King was not naturally cruel 
(though very passionate), he was wise, and must have known full 
well what any stupid man in his dominions must have known, 
namely, that such a murder would rouse the Pope and the whole 
Church against him.</p>
<p>He sent respectful messengers to the Pope, to represent his 
innocence (except in having uttered the hasty words); and he 
swore solemnly and publicly to his innocence, and contrived in 
time to make his peace.&nbsp; As to the four guilty Knights, who 
fled into Yorkshire, and never again dared to show themselves at 
Court, the Pope excommunicated them; and they lived miserably for
some time, shunned by all their countrymen.&nbsp; At last, they 
went humbly to Jerusalem as a penance, and there died and were 
buried.</p>
<p>It happened, fortunately for the pacifying of the Pope, that 
an opportunity arose very soon after the murder of &agrave; 
Becket, for the King to declare his power in Ireland&mdash;which 
was an acceptable undertaking to the Pope, as the Irish, who had 
been converted to Christianity by one Patricius (otherwise Saint 
Patrick) long ago, before any Pope existed, considered that the 
Pope had nothing at all to do with them, or they with the Pope, 
and accordingly refused to pay him Peter&rsquo;s Pence, or that 
tax of a penny a house which I have elsewhere mentioned.&nbsp; 
The King&rsquo;s opportunity arose in this way.</p>
<p>The Irish were, at that time, as barbarous a people as you can
well imagine.&nbsp; They were continually quarrelling and 
fighting, cutting one another&rsquo;s throats, slicing one 
another&rsquo;s noses, burning one another&rsquo;s houses, 
carrying away one another&rsquo;s wives, and committing all sorts
of violence.&nbsp; The country was divided into five 
kingdoms&mdash;<span class="smcap">Desmond, Thomond</span>, <span
class="smcap">Connaught</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Ulster</span>, and <span 
class="smcap">Leinster</span>&mdash;each governed by a separate 
King, of whom one claimed to be the chief of the rest.&nbsp; Now,
one of these Kings, named <span class="smcap">Dermond Mac 
Murrough</span> (a wild kind of name, spelt in more than one wild
kind of way), had carried off the wife of a friend of his, and 
concealed her on an island in a bog.&nbsp; The friend resenting 
this (though it was quite the custom of the country), complained 
to the chief King, and, with the chief King&rsquo;s help, drove 
Dermond Mac Murrough out of his dominions.&nbsp; Dermond came 
over to England for revenge; and offered to hold his realm as a 
vassal of King Henry, if King Henry would help him to regain 
it.&nbsp; The King consented to these terms; but only assisted 
him, then, with what were called Letters Patent, authorising any 
English subjects who were so disposed, to enter into his service,
and aid his cause.</p>
<p>There was, at Bristol, a certain <span class="smcap">Earl 
Richard de Clare</span>, called <span 
class="smcap">Strongbow</span>; of no very good character; needy 
and desperate, and ready for anything that offered him a chance 
of improving his fortunes.&nbsp; There were, in South Wales, two 
other broken knights of the same good-for-nothing sort, called 
<span class="smcap">Robert Fitz-Stephen</span>, and <span 
class="smcap">Maurice Fitz-Gerald</span>.&nbsp; These three, each
with a small band of followers, took up Dermond&rsquo;s cause; 
and it was agreed that if it proved successful, Strongbow should 
marry Dermond&rsquo;s daughter <span class="smcap">Eva</span>, 
and be declared his heir.</p>
<p>The trained English followers of these knights were so 
superior in all the discipline of battle to the Irish, that they 
beat them against immense superiority of numbers.&nbsp; In one 
fight, early in the war, they cut off three hundred heads, and 
laid them before Mac Murrough; who turned them every one up with 
his hands, rejoicing, and, coming to one which was the head of a 
man whom he had much disliked, grasped it by the hair and ears, 
and tore off the nose and lips with his teeth.&nbsp; You may 
judge from this, what kind of a gentleman an Irish King in those 
times was.&nbsp; The captives, all through this war, were 
horribly treated; the victorious party making nothing of breaking
their limbs, and casting them into the sea from the tops of high 
rocks.&nbsp; It was in the midst of the miseries and cruelties 
attendant on the taking of Waterford, where the dead lay piled in
the streets, and the filthy gutters ran with blood, that 
Strongbow married Eva.&nbsp; An odious marriage-company those 
mounds of corpse&rsquo;s must have made, I think, and one quite 
worthy of the young lady&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>He died, after Waterford and Dublin had been taken, and 
various successes achieved; and Strongbow became King of 
Leinster.&nbsp; Now came King Henry&rsquo;s opportunity.&nbsp; To
restrain the growing power of Strongbow, he himself repaired to 
Dublin, as Strongbow&rsquo;s Royal Master, and deprived him of 
his kingdom, but confirmed him in the enjoyment of great 
possessions.&nbsp; The King, then, holding state in Dublin, 
received the homage of nearly all the Irish Kings and Chiefs, and
so came home again with a great addition to his reputation as 
Lord of Ireland, and with a new claim on the favour of the 
Pope.&nbsp; And now, their reconciliation was 
completed&mdash;more easily and mildly by the Pope, than the King
might have expected, I think.</p>
<p>At this period of his reign, when his troubles seemed so few 
and his prospects so bright, those domestic miseries began which 
gradually made the King the most unhappy of men, reduced his 
great spirit, wore away his health, and broke his heart.</p>
<p>He had four sons.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, now 
aged eighteen&mdash;his secret crowning of whom had given such 
offence to Thomas &agrave; Becket.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Richard</span>, aged sixteen; <span 
class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>, fifteen; and <span 
class="smcap">John</span>, his favourite, a young boy whom the 
courtiers named <span class="smcap">Lackland</span>, because he 
had no inheritance, but to whom the King meant to give the 
Lordship of Ireland.&nbsp; All these misguided boys, in their 
turn, were unnatural sons to him, and unnatural brothers to each 
other.&nbsp; Prince Henry, stimulated by the French King, and by 
his bad mother, Queen Eleanor, began the undutiful history,</p>
<p>First, he demanded that his young wife, <span 
class="smcap">Margaret</span>, the French King&rsquo;s daughter, 
should be crowned as well as he.&nbsp; His father, the King, 
consented, and it was done.&nbsp; It was no sooner done, than he 
demanded to have a part of his father&rsquo;s dominions, during 
his father&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; This being refused, he made off 
from his father in the night, with his bad heart full of 
bitterness, and took refuge at the French King&rsquo;s 
Court.&nbsp; Within a day or two, his brothers Richard and 
Geoffrey followed.&nbsp; Their mother tried to join 
them&mdash;escaping in man&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;but she was 
seized by King Henry&rsquo;s men, and immured in prison, where 
she lay, deservedly, for sixteen years.&nbsp; Every day, however,
some grasping English noblemen, to whom the King&rsquo;s 
protection of his people from their avarice and oppression had 
given offence, deserted him and joined the Princes.&nbsp; Every 
day he heard some fresh intelligence of the Princes levying 
armies against him; of Prince Henry&rsquo;s wearing a crown 
before his own ambassadors at the French Court, and being called 
the Junior King of England; of all the Princes swearing never to 
make peace with him, their father, without the consent and 
approval of the Barons of France.&nbsp; But, with his fortitude 
and energy unshaken, King Henry met the shock of these disasters 
with a resolved and cheerful face.&nbsp; He called upon all Royal
fathers who had sons, to help him, for his cause was theirs; he 
hired, out of his riches, twenty thousand men to fight the false 
French King, who stirred his own blood against him; and he 
carried on the war with such vigour, that Louis soon proposed a 
conference to treat for peace.</p>
<p>The conference was held beneath an old wide-spreading green 
elm-tree, upon a plain in France.&nbsp; It led to nothing.&nbsp; 
The war recommenced.&nbsp; Prince Richard began his fighting 
career, by leading an army against his father; but his father 
beat him and his army back; and thousands of his men would have 
rued the day in which they fought in such a wicked cause, had not
the King received news of an invasion of England by the Scots, 
and promptly come home through a great storm to repress it.&nbsp;
And whether he really began to fear that he suffered these 
troubles because &agrave; Becket had been murdered; or whether he
wished to rise in the favour of the Pope, who had now declared 
&agrave; Becket to be a saint, or in the favour of his own 
people, of whom many believed that even &agrave; Becket&rsquo;s 
senseless tomb could work miracles, I don&rsquo;t know: but the 
King no sooner landed in England than he went straight to 
Canterbury; and when he came within sight of the distant 
Cathedral, he dismounted from his horse, took off his shoes, and 
walked with bare and bleeding feet to &agrave; Becket&rsquo;s 
grave.&nbsp; There, he lay down on the ground, lamenting, in the 
presence of many people; and by-and-by he went into the Chapter 
House, and, removing his clothes from his back and shoulders, 
submitted himself to be beaten with knotted cords (not beaten 
very hard, I dare say though) by eighty Priests, one after 
another.&nbsp; It chanced that on the very day when the King made
this curious exhibition of himself, a complete victory was 
obtained over the Scots; which very much delighted the Priests, 
who said that it was won because of his great example of 
repentance.&nbsp; For the Priests in general had found out, since
&agrave; Becket&rsquo;s death, that they admired him of all 
things&mdash;though they had hated him very cordially when he was
alive.</p>
<p>The Earl of Flanders, who was at the head of the base 
conspiracy of the King&rsquo;s undutiful sons and their foreign 
friends, took the opportunity of the King being thus employed at 
home, to lay siege to Rouen, the capital of Normandy.&nbsp; But 
the King, who was extraordinarily quick and active in all his 
movements, was at Rouen, too, before it was supposed possible 
that he could have left England; and there he so defeated the 
said Earl of Flanders, that the conspirators proposed peace, and 
his bad sons Henry and Geoffrey submitted.&nbsp; Richard resisted
for six weeks; but, being beaten out of castle after castle, he 
at last submitted too, and his father forgave him.</p>
<p>To forgive these unworthy princes was only to afford them 
breathing-time for new faithlessness.&nbsp; They were so false, 
disloyal, and dishonourable, that they were no more to be trusted
than common thieves.&nbsp; In the very next year, Prince Henry 
rebelled again, and was again forgiven.&nbsp; In eight years 
more, Prince Richard rebelled against his elder brother; and 
Prince Geoffrey infamously said that the brothers could never 
agree well together, unless they were united against their 
father.&nbsp; In the very next year after their reconciliation by
the King, Prince Henry again rebelled against his father; and 
again submitted, swearing to be true; and was again forgiven; and
again rebelled with Geoffrey.</p>
<p>But the end of this perfidious Prince was come.&nbsp; He fell 
sick at a French town; and his conscience terribly reproaching 
him with his baseness, he sent messengers to the King his father,
imploring him to come and see him, and to forgive him for the 
last time on his bed of death.&nbsp; The generous King, who had a
royal and forgiving mind towards his children always, would have 
gone; but this Prince had been so unnatural, that the noblemen 
about the King suspected treachery, and represented to him that 
he could not safely trust his life with such a traitor, though 
his own eldest son.&nbsp; Therefore the King sent him a ring from
off his finger as a token of forgiveness; and when the Prince had
kissed it, with much grief and many tears, and had confessed to 
those around him how bad, and wicked, and undutiful a son he had 
been; he said to the attendant Priests: &lsquo;O, tie a rope 
about my body, and draw me out of bed, and lay me down upon a bed
of ashes, that I may die with prayers to God in a repentant 
manner!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he died, at twenty-seven years 
old.</p>
<p>Three years afterwards, Prince Geoffrey, being unhorsed at a 
tournament, had his brains trampled out by a crowd of horses 
passing over him.&nbsp; So, there only remained Prince Richard, 
and Prince John&mdash;who had grown to be a young man now, and 
had solemnly sworn to be faithful to his father.&nbsp; Richard 
soon rebelled again, encouraged by his friend the French King, 
<span class="smcap">Philip the Second</span> (son of Louis, who 
was dead); and soon submitted and was again forgiven, swearing on
the New Testament never to rebel again; and in another year or 
so, rebelled again; and, in the presence of his father, knelt 
down on his knee before the King of France; and did the French 
King homage: and declared that with his aid he would possess 
himself, by force, of all his father&rsquo;s French 
dominions.</p>
<p>And yet this Richard called himself a soldier of Our 
Saviour!&nbsp; And yet this Richard wore the Cross, which the 
Kings of France and England had both taken, in the previous year,
at a brotherly meeting underneath the old wide-spreading elm-tree
on the plain, when they had sworn (like him) to devote themselves
to a new Crusade, for the love and honour of the Truth!</p>
<p>Sick at heart, wearied out by the falsehood of his sons, and 
almost ready to lie down and die, the unhappy King who had so 
long stood firm, began to fail.&nbsp; But the Pope, to his 
honour, supported him; and obliged the French King and Richard, 
though successful in fight, to treat for peace.&nbsp; Richard 
wanted to be Crowned King of England, and pretended that he 
wanted to be married (which he really did not) to the French 
King&rsquo;s sister, his promised wife, whom King Henry detained 
in England.&nbsp; King Henry wanted, on the other hand, that the 
French King&rsquo;s sister should be married to his favourite 
son, John: the only one of his sons (he said) who had never 
rebelled against him.&nbsp; At last King Henry, deserted by his 
nobles one by one, distressed, exhausted, broken-hearted, 
consented to establish peace.</p>
<p>One final heavy sorrow was reserved for him, even yet.&nbsp; 
When they brought him the proposed treaty of peace, in writing, 
as he lay very ill in bed, they brought him also the list of the 
deserters from their allegiance, whom he was required to 
pardon.&nbsp; The first name upon this list was John, his 
favourite son, in whom he had trusted to the last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O John! child of my heart!&rsquo; exclaimed the King, 
in a great agony of mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;O John, whom I have loved 
the best!&nbsp; O John, for whom I have contended through these 
many troubles!&nbsp; Have you betrayed me too!&rsquo;&nbsp; And 
then he lay down with a heavy groan, and said, &lsquo;Now let the
world go as it will.&nbsp; I care for nothing more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a time, he told his attendants to take him to the French
town of Chinon&mdash;a town he had been fond of, during many 
years.&nbsp; But he was fond of no place now; it was too true 
that he could care for nothing more upon this earth.&nbsp; He 
wildly cursed the hour when he was born, and cursed the children 
whom he left behind him; and expired.</p>
<p>As, one hundred years before, the servile followers of the 
Court had abandoned the Conqueror in the hour of his death, so 
they now abandoned his descendant.&nbsp; The very body was 
stripped, in the plunder of the Royal chamber; and it was not 
easy to find the means of carrying it for burial to the abbey 
church of Fontevraud.</p>
<p>Richard was said in after years, by way of flattery, to have 
the heart of a Lion.&nbsp; It would have been far better, I 
think, to have had the heart of a Man.&nbsp; His heart, whatever 
it was, had cause to beat remorsefully within his breast, when he
came&mdash;as he did&mdash;into the solemn abbey, and looked on 
his dead father&rsquo;s uncovered face.&nbsp; His heart, whatever
it was, had been a black and perjured heart, in all its dealings 
with the deceased King, and more deficient in a single touch of 
tenderness than any wild beast&rsquo;s in the forest.</p>
<p>There is a pretty story told of this Reign, called the story 
of <span class="smcap">Fair Rosamond</span>.&nbsp; It relates how
the King doted on Fair Rosamond, who was the loveliest girl in 
all the world; and how he had a beautiful Bower built for her in 
a Park at Woodstock; and how it was erected in a labyrinth, and 
could only be found by a clue of silk.&nbsp; How the bad Queen 
Eleanor, becoming jealous of Fair Rosamond, found out the secret 
of the clue, and one day, appeared before her, with a dagger and 
a cup of poison, and left her to the choice between those 
deaths.&nbsp; How Fair Rosamond, after shedding many piteous 
tears and offering many useless prayers to the cruel Queen, took 
the poison, and fell dead in the midst of the beautiful bower, 
while the unconscious birds sang gaily all around her.</p>
<p>Now, there <i>was</i> a fair Rosamond, and she was (I dare 
say) the loveliest girl in all the world, and the King was 
certainly very fond of her, and the bad Queen Eleanor was 
certainly made jealous.&nbsp; But I am afraid&mdash;I say afraid,
because I like the story so much&mdash;that there was no bower, 
no labyrinth, no silken clue, no dagger, no poison.&nbsp; I am 
afraid fair Rosamond retired to a nunnery near Oxford, and died 
there, peaceably; her sister-nuns hanging a silken drapery over 
her tomb, and often dressing it with flowers, in remembrance of 
the youth and beauty that had enchanted the King when he too was 
young, and when his life lay fair before him.</p>
<p>It was dark and ended now; faded and gone.&nbsp; Henry 
Plantagenet lay quiet in the abbey church of Fontevraud, in the 
fifty-seventh year of his age&mdash;never to be 
completed&mdash;after governing England well, for nearly 
thirty-five years.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE FIRST, CALLED 
THE LION-HEART</h2>
<p>In the year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and 
eighty-nine, Richard of the Lion Heart succeeded to the throne of
King Henry the Second, whose paternal heart he had done so much 
to break.&nbsp; He had been, as we have seen, a rebel from his 
boyhood; but, the moment he became a king against whom others 
might rebel, he found out that rebellion was a great 
wickedness.&nbsp; In the heat of this pious discovery, he 
punished all the leading people who had befriended him against 
his father.&nbsp; He could scarcely have done anything that would
have been a better instance of his real nature, or a better 
warning to fawners and parasites not to trust in lion-hearted 
princes.</p>
<p>He likewise put his late father&rsquo;s treasurer in chains, 
and locked him up in a dungeon from which he was not set free 
until he had relinquished, not only all the Crown treasure, but 
all his own money too.&nbsp; So, Richard certainly got the 
Lion&rsquo;s share of the wealth of this wretched treasurer, 
whether he had a Lion&rsquo;s heart or not.</p>
<p>He was crowned King of England, with great pomp, at 
Westminster: walking to the Cathedral under a silken canopy 
stretched on the tops of four lances, each carried by a great 
lord.&nbsp; On the day of his coronation, a dreadful murdering of
the Jews took place, which seems to have given great delight to 
numbers of savage persons calling themselves Christians.&nbsp; 
The King had issued a proclamation forbidding the Jews (who were 
generally hated, though they were the most useful merchants in 
England) to appear at the ceremony; but as they had assembled in 
London from all parts, bringing presents to show their respect 
for the new Sovereign, some of them ventured down to Westminster 
Hall with their gifts; which were very readily accepted.&nbsp; It
is supposed, now, that some noisy fellow in the crowd, pretending
to be a very delicate Christian, set up a howl at this, and 
struck a Jew who was trying to get in at the Hall door with his 
present.&nbsp; A riot arose.&nbsp; The Jews who had got into the 
Hall, were driven forth; and some of the rabble cried out that 
the new King had commanded the unbelieving race to be put to 
death.&nbsp; Thereupon the crowd rushed through the narrow 
streets of the city, slaughtering all the Jews they met; and when
they could find no more out of doors (on account of their having 
fled to their houses, and fastened themselves in), they ran madly
about, breaking open all the houses where the Jews lived, rushing
in and stabbing or spearing them, sometimes even flinging old 
people and children out of window into blazing fires they had 
lighted up below.&nbsp; This great cruelty lasted four-and-twenty
hours, and only three men were punished for it.&nbsp; Even they 
forfeited their lives not for murdering and robbing the Jews, but
for burning the houses of some Christians.</p>
<p>King Richard, who was a strong, restless, burly man, with one 
idea always in his head, and that the very troublesome idea of 
breaking the heads of other men, was mightily impatient to go on 
a Crusade to the Holy Land, with a great army.&nbsp; As great 
armies could not be raised to go, even to the Holy Land, without 
a great deal of money, he sold the Crown domains, and even the 
high offices of State; recklessly appointing noblemen to rule 
over his English subjects, not because they were fit to govern, 
but because they could pay high for the privilege.&nbsp; In this 
way, and by selling pardons at a dear rate and by varieties of 
avarice and oppression, he scraped together a large 
treasure.&nbsp; He then appointed two Bishops to take care of his
kingdom in his absence, and gave great powers and possessions to 
his brother John, to secure his friendship.&nbsp; John would 
rather have been made Regent of England; but he was a sly man, 
and friendly to the expedition; saying to himself, no doubt, 
&lsquo;The more fighting, the more chance of my brother being 
killed; and when he <i>is</i> killed, then I become King 
John!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before the newly levied army departed from England, the 
recruits and the general populace distinguished themselves by 
astonishing cruelties on the unfortunate Jews: whom, in many 
large towns, they murdered by hundreds in the most horrible 
manner.</p>
<p>At York, a large body of Jews took refuge in the Castle, in 
the absence of its Governor, after the wives and children of many
of them had been slain before their eyes.&nbsp; Presently came 
the Governor, and demanded admission.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can we 
give it thee, O Governor!&rsquo; said the Jews upon the walls, 
&lsquo;when, if we open the gate by so much as the width of a 
foot, the roaring crowd behind thee will press in and kill 
us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon this, the unjust Governor became angry, and told the 
people that he approved of their killing those Jews; and a 
mischievous maniac of a friar, dressed all in white, put himself 
at the head of the assault, and they assaulted the Castle for 
three days.</p>
<p>Then said <span class="smcap">Jocen</span>, the head-Jew (who 
was a Rabbi or Priest), to the rest, &lsquo;Brethren, there is no
hope for us with the Christians who are hammering at the gates 
and walls, and who must soon break in.&nbsp; As we and our wives 
and children must die, either by Christian hands, or by our own, 
let it be by our own.&nbsp; Let us destroy by fire what jewels 
and other treasure we have here, then fire the castle, and then 
perish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few could not resolve to do this, but the greater part 
complied.&nbsp; They made a blazing heap of all their valuables, 
and, when those were consumed, set the castle in flames.&nbsp; 
While the flames roared and crackled around them, and shooting up
into the sky, turned it blood-red, Jocen cut the throat of his 
beloved wife, and stabbed himself.&nbsp; All the others who had 
wives or children, did the like dreadful deed.&nbsp; When the 
populace broke in, they found (except the trembling few, cowering
in corners, whom they soon killed) only heaps of greasy cinders, 
with here and there something like part of the blackened trunk of
a burnt tree, but which had lately been a human creature, formed 
by the beneficent hand of the Creator as they were.</p>
<p>After this bad beginning, Richard and his troops went on, in 
no very good manner, with the Holy Crusade.&nbsp; It was 
undertaken jointly by the King of England and his old friend 
Philip of France.&nbsp; They commenced the business by reviewing 
their forces, to the number of one hundred thousand men.&nbsp; 
Afterwards, they severally embarked their troops for Messina, in 
Sicily, which was appointed as the next place of meeting.</p>
<p>King Richard&rsquo;s sister had married the King of this 
place, but he was dead: and his uncle <span 
class="smcap">Tancred</span> had usurped the crown, cast the 
Royal Widow into prison, and possessed himself of her 
estates.&nbsp; Richard fiercely demanded his sister&rsquo;s 
release, the restoration of her lands, and (according to the 
Royal custom of the Island) that she should have a golden chair, 
a golden table, four-and-twenty silver cups, and four-and-twenty 
silver dishes.&nbsp; As he was too powerful to be successfully 
resisted, Tancred yielded to his demands; and then the French 
King grew jealous, and complained that the English King wanted to
be absolute in the Island of Messina and everywhere else.&nbsp; 
Richard, however, cared little or nothing for this complaint; and
in consideration of a present of twenty thousand pieces of gold, 
promised his pretty little nephew <span 
class="smcap">Arthur</span>, then a child of two years old, in 
marriage to Tancred&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; We shall hear again 
of pretty little Arthur by-and-by.</p>
<p>This Sicilian affair arranged without anybody&rsquo;s brains 
being knocked out (which must have rather disappointed him), King
Richard took his sister away, and also a fair lady named <span 
class="smcap">Berengaria</span>, with whom he had fallen in love 
in France, and whom his mother, Queen Eleanor (so long in prison,
you remember, but released by Richard on his coming to the 
Throne), had brought out there to be his wife; and sailed with 
them for Cyprus.</p>
<p>He soon had the pleasure of fighting the King of the Island of
Cyprus, for allowing his subjects to pillage some of the English 
troops who were shipwrecked on the shore; and easily conquering 
this poor monarch, he seized his only daughter, to be a companion
to the lady Berengaria, and put the King himself into silver 
fetters.&nbsp; He then sailed away again with his mother, sister,
wife, and the captive princess; and soon arrived before the town 
of Acre, which the French King with his fleet was besieging from 
the sea.&nbsp; But the French King was in no triumphant 
condition, for his army had been thinned by the swords of the 
Saracens, and wasted by the plague; and <span 
class="smcap">Saladin</span>, the brave Sultan of the Turks, at 
the head of a numerous army, was at that time gallantly defending
the place from the hills that rise above it.</p>
<p>Wherever the united army of Crusaders went, they agreed in few
points except in gaming, drinking, and quarrelling, in a most 
unholy manner; in debauching the people among whom they tarried, 
whether they were friends or foes; and in carrying disturbance 
and ruin into quiet places.&nbsp; The French King was jealous of 
the English King, and the English King was jealous of the French 
King, and the disorderly and violent soldiers of the two nations 
were jealous of one another; consequently, the two Kings could 
not at first agree, even upon a joint assault on Acre; but when 
they did make up their quarrel for that purpose, the Saracens 
promised to yield the town, to give up to the Christians the wood
of the Holy Cross, to set at liberty all their Christian 
captives, and to pay two hundred thousand pieces of gold.&nbsp; 
All this was to be done within forty days; but, not being done, 
King Richard ordered some three thousand Saracen prisoners to be 
brought out in the front of his camp, and there, in full view of 
their own countrymen, to be butchered.</p>
<p>The French King had no part in this crime; for he was by that 
time travelling homeward with the greater part of his men; being 
offended by the overbearing conduct of the English King; being 
anxious to look after his own dominions; and being ill, besides, 
from the unwholesome air of that hot and sandy country.&nbsp; 
King Richard carried on the war without him; and remained in the 
East, meeting with a variety of adventures, nearly a year and a 
half.&nbsp; Every night when his army was on the march, and came 
to a halt, the heralds cried out three times, to remind all the 
soldiers of the cause in which they were engaged, &lsquo;Save the
Holy Sepulchre!&rsquo; and then all the soldiers knelt and said 
&lsquo;Amen!&rsquo;&nbsp; Marching or encamping, the army had 
continually to strive with the hot air of the glaring desert, or 
with the Saracen soldiers animated and directed by the brave 
Saladin, or with both together.&nbsp; Sickness and death, battle 
and wounds, were always among them; but through every difficulty 
King Richard fought like a giant, and worked like a common 
labourer.&nbsp; Long and long after he was quiet in his grave, 
his terrible battle-axe, with twenty English pounds of English 
steel in its mighty head, was a legend among the Saracens; and 
when all the Saracen and Christian hosts had been dust for many a
year, if a Saracen horse started at any object by the wayside, 
his rider would exclaim, &lsquo;What dost thou fear, Fool?&nbsp; 
Dost thou think King Richard is behind it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No one admired this King&rsquo;s renown for bravery more than 
Saladin himself, who was a generous and gallant enemy.&nbsp; When
Richard lay ill of a fever, Saladin sent him fresh fruits from 
Damascus, and snow from the mountain-tops.&nbsp; Courtly messages
and compliments were frequently exchanged between them&mdash;and 
then King Richard would mount his horse and kill as many Saracens
as he could; and Saladin would mount his, and kill as many 
Christians as he could.&nbsp; In this way King Richard fought to 
his heart&rsquo;s content at Arsoof and at Jaffa; and finding 
himself with nothing exciting to do at Ascalon, except to 
rebuild, for his own defence, some fortifications there which the
Saracens had destroyed, he kicked his ally the Duke of Austria, 
for being too proud to work at them.</p>
<p>The army at last came within sight of the Holy City of 
Jerusalem; but, being then a mere nest of jealousy, and 
quarrelling and fighting, soon retired, and agreed with the 
Saracens upon a truce for three years, three months, three days, 
and three hours.&nbsp; Then, the English Christians, protected by
the noble Saladin from Saracen revenge, visited Our 
Saviour&rsquo;s tomb; and then King Richard embarked with a small
force at Acre to return home.</p>
<p>But he was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea, and was fain to 
pass through Germany, under an assumed name.&nbsp; Now, there 
were many people in Germany who had served in the Holy Land under
that proud Duke of Austria who had been kicked; and some of them,
easily recognising a man so remarkable as King Richard, carried 
their intelligence to the kicked Duke, who straightway took him 
prisoner at a little inn near Vienna.</p>
<p>The Duke&rsquo;s master the Emperor of Germany, and the King 
of France, were equally delighted to have so troublesome a 
monarch in safe keeping.&nbsp; Friendships which are founded on a
partnership in doing wrong, are never true; and the King of 
France was now quite as heartily King Richard&rsquo;s foe, as he 
had ever been his friend in his unnatural conduct to his 
father.&nbsp; He monstrously pretended that King Richard had 
designed to poison him in the East; he charged him with having 
murdered, there, a man whom he had in truth befriended; he bribed
the Emperor of Germany to keep him close prisoner; and, finally, 
through the plotting of these two princes, Richard was brought 
before the German legislature, charged with the foregoing crimes,
and many others.&nbsp; But he defended himself so well, that many
of the assembly were moved to tears by his eloquence and 
earnestness.&nbsp; It was decided that he should be treated, 
during the rest of his captivity, in a manner more becoming his 
dignity than he had been, and that he should be set free on the 
payment of a heavy ransom.&nbsp; This ransom the English people 
willingly raised.&nbsp; When Queen Eleanor took it over to 
Germany, it was at first evaded and refused.&nbsp; But she 
appealed to the honour of all the princes of the German Empire in
behalf of her son, and appealed so well that it was accepted, and
the King released.&nbsp; Thereupon, the King of France wrote to 
Prince John&mdash;&lsquo;Take care of thyself.&nbsp; The devil is
unchained!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prince John had reason to fear his brother, for he had been a 
traitor to him in his captivity.&nbsp; He had secretly joined the
French King; had vowed to the English nobles and people that his 
brother was dead; and had vainly tried to seize the crown.&nbsp; 
He was now in France, at a place called Evreux.&nbsp; Being the 
meanest and basest of men, he contrived a mean and base expedient
for making himself acceptable to his brother.&nbsp; He invited 
the French officers of the garrison in that town to dinner, 
murdered them all, and then took the fortress.&nbsp; With this 
recommendation to the good will of a lion-hearted monarch, he 
hastened to King Richard, fell on his knees before him, and 
obtained the intercession of Queen Eleanor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
forgive him,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;and I hope I may forget
the injury he has done me, as easily as I know he will forget my 
pardon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While King Richard was in Sicily, there had been trouble in 
his dominions at home: one of the bishops whom he had left in 
charge thereof, arresting the other; and making, in his pride and
ambition, as great a show as if he were King himself.&nbsp; But 
the King hearing of it at Messina, and appointing a new Regency, 
this <span class="smcap">Longchamp</span> (for that was his name)
had fled to France in a woman&rsquo;s dress, and had there been 
encouraged and supported by the French King.&nbsp; With all these
causes of offence against Philip in his mind, King Richard had no
sooner been welcomed home by his enthusiastic subjects with great
display and splendour, and had no sooner been crowned afresh at 
Winchester, than he resolved to show the French King that the 
Devil was unchained indeed, and made war against him with great 
fury.</p>
<p>There was fresh trouble at home about this time, arising out 
of the discontents of the poor people, who complained that they 
were far more heavily taxed than the rich, and who found a 
spirited champion in <span class="smcap">William 
Fitz-Osbert</span>, called <span 
class="smcap">Longbeard</span>.&nbsp; He became the leader of a 
secret society, comprising fifty thousand men; he was seized by 
surprise; he stabbed the citizen who first laid hands upon him; 
and retreated, bravely fighting, to a church, which he maintained
four days, until he was dislodged by fire, and run through the 
body as he came out.&nbsp; He was not killed, though; for he was 
dragged, half dead, at the tail of a horse to Smithfield, and 
there hanged.&nbsp; Death was long a favourite remedy for 
silencing the people&rsquo;s advocates; but as we go on with this
history, I fancy we shall find them difficult to make an end of, 
for all that.</p>
<p>The French war, delayed occasionally by a truce, was still in 
progress when a certain Lord named <span 
class="smcap">Vidomar</span>, Viscount of Limoges, chanced to 
find in his ground a treasure of ancient coins.&nbsp; As the 
King&rsquo;s vassal, he sent the King half of it; but the King 
claimed the whole.&nbsp; The lord refused to yield the 
whole.&nbsp; The King besieged the lord in his castle, swore that
he would take the castle by storm, and hang every man of its 
defenders on the battlements.</p>
<p>There was a strange old song in that part of the country, to 
the effect that in Limoges an arrow would be made by which King 
Richard would die.&nbsp; It may be that <span 
class="smcap">Bertrand de Gourdon</span>, a young man who was one
of the defenders of the castle, had often sung it or heard it 
sung of a winter night, and remembered it when he saw, from his 
post upon the ramparts, the King attended only by his chief 
officer riding below the walls surveying the place.&nbsp; He drew
an arrow to the head, took steady aim, said between his teeth, 
&lsquo;Now I pray God speed thee well, arrow!&rsquo; discharged 
it, and struck the King in the left shoulder.</p>
<p>Although the wound was not at first considered dangerous, it 
was severe enough to cause the King to retire to his tent, and 
direct the assault to be made without him.&nbsp; The castle was 
taken; and every man of its defenders was hanged, as the King had
sworn all should be, except Bertrand de Gourdon, who was reserved
until the royal pleasure respecting him should be known.</p>
<p>By that time unskilful treatment had made the wound mortal and
the King knew that he was dying.&nbsp; He directed Bertrand to be
brought into his tent.&nbsp; The young man was brought there, 
heavily chained, King Richard looked at him steadily.&nbsp; He 
looked, as steadily, at the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knave!&rsquo; said King Richard.&nbsp; &lsquo;What have
I done to thee that thou shouldest take my life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What hast thou done to me?&rsquo; replied the young 
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;With thine own hands thou hast killed my father
and my two brothers.&nbsp; Myself thou wouldest have 
hanged.&nbsp; Let me die now, by any torture that thou 
wilt.&nbsp; My comfort is, that no torture can save Thee.&nbsp; 
Thou too must die; and, through me, the world is quit of 
thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again the King looked at the young man steadily.&nbsp; Again 
the young man looked steadily at him.&nbsp; Perhaps some 
remembrance of his generous enemy Saladin, who was not a 
Christian, came into the mind of the dying King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Youth!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I forgive thee.&nbsp; Go 
unhurt!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, turning to the chief officer who had 
been riding in his company when he received the wound, King 
Richard said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take off his chains, give him a hundred shillings, and 
let him depart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sunk down on his couch, and a dark mist seemed in his 
weakened eyes to fill the tent wherein he had so often rested, 
and he died.&nbsp; His age was forty-two; he had reigned ten 
years.&nbsp; His last command was not obeyed; for the chief 
officer flayed Bertrand de Gourdon alive, and hanged him.</p>
<p>There is an old tune yet known&mdash;a sorrowful air will 
sometimes outlive many generations of strong men, and even last 
longer than battle-axes with twenty pounds of steel in the 
head&mdash;by which this King is said to have been discovered in 
his captivity.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Blondel</span>, a 
favourite Minstrel of King Richard, as the story relates, 
faithfully seeking his Royal master, went singing it outside the 
gloomy walls of many foreign fortresses and prisons; until at 
last he heard it echoed from within a dungeon, and knew the 
voice, and cried out in ecstasy, &lsquo;O Richard, O my 
King!&rsquo;&nbsp; You may believe it, if you like; it would be 
easy to believe worse things.&nbsp; Richard was himself a 
Minstrel and a Poet.&nbsp; If he had not been a Prince too, he 
might have been a better man perhaps, and might have gone out of 
the world with less bloodshed and waste of life to answer 
for.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER KING JOHN, CALLED 
LACKLAND</h2>
<p>At two-and-thirty years of age, <span 
class="smcap">John</span> became King of England.&nbsp; His 
pretty little nephew <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> had the 
best claim to the throne; but John seized the treasure, and made 
fine promises to the nobility, and got himself crowned at 
Westminster within a few weeks after his brother Richard&rsquo;s 
death.&nbsp; I doubt whether the crown could possibly have been 
put upon the head of a meaner coward, or a more detestable 
villain, if England had been searched from end to end to find him
out.</p>
<p>The French King, Philip, refused to acknowledge the right of 
John to his new dignity, and declared in favour of Arthur.&nbsp; 
You must not suppose that he had any generosity of feeling for 
the fatherless boy; it merely suited his ambitious schemes to 
oppose the King of England.&nbsp; So John and the French King 
went to war about Arthur.</p>
<p>He was a handsome boy, at that time only twelve years 
old.&nbsp; He was not born when his father, Geoffrey, had his 
brains trampled out at the tournament; and, besides the 
misfortune of never having known a father&rsquo;s guidance and 
protection, he had the additional misfortune to have a foolish 
mother (<span class="smcap">Constance</span> by name), lately 
married to her third husband.&nbsp; She took Arthur, upon 
John&rsquo;s accession, to the French King, who pretended to be 
very much his friend, and who made him a Knight, and promised him
his daughter in marriage; but, who cared so little about him in 
reality, that finding it his interest to make peace with King 
John for a time, he did so without the least consideration for 
the poor little Prince, and heartlessly sacrificed all his 
interests.</p>
<p>Young Arthur, for two years afterwards, lived quietly; and in 
the course of that time his mother died.&nbsp; But, the French 
King then finding it his interest to quarrel with King John 
again, again made Arthur his pretence, and invited the orphan boy
to court.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know your rights, Prince,&rsquo; said 
the French King, &lsquo;and you would like to be a King.&nbsp; Is
it not so?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Truly,&rsquo; said Prince Arthur, 
&lsquo;I should greatly like to be a King!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Philip, &lsquo;you shall have two 
hundred gentlemen who are Knights of mine, and with them you 
shall go to win back the provinces belonging to you, of which 
your uncle, the usurping King of England, has taken 
possession.&nbsp; I myself, meanwhile, will head a force against 
him in Normandy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Poor Arthur was so flattered and so
grateful that he signed a treaty with the crafty French King, 
agreeing to consider him his superior Lord, and that the French 
King should keep for himself whatever he could take from King 
John.</p>
<p>Now, King John was so bad in all ways, and King Philip was so 
perfidious, that Arthur, between the two, might as well have been
a lamb between a fox and a wolf.&nbsp; But, being so young, he 
was ardent and flushed with hope; and, when the people of 
Brittany (which was his inheritance) sent him five hundred more 
knights and five thousand foot soldiers, he believed his fortune 
was made.&nbsp; The people of Brittany had been fond of him from 
his birth, and had requested that he might be called Arthur, in 
remembrance of that dimly-famous English Arthur, of whom I told 
you early in this book, whom they believed to have been the brave
friend and companion of an old King of their own.&nbsp; They had 
tales among them about a prophet called <span 
class="smcap">Merlin</span> (of the same old time), who had 
foretold that their own King should be restored to them after 
hundreds of years; and they believed that the prophecy would be 
fulfilled in Arthur; that the time would come when he would rule 
them with a crown of Brittany upon his head; and when neither 
King of France nor King of England would have any power over 
them.&nbsp; When Arthur found himself riding in a glittering suit
of armour on a richly caparisoned horse, at the head of his train
of knights and soldiers, he began to believe this too, and to 
consider old Merlin a very superior prophet.</p>
<p>He did not know&mdash;how could he, being so innocent and 
inexperienced?&mdash;that his little army was a mere nothing 
against the power of the King of England.&nbsp; The French King 
knew it; but the poor boy&rsquo;s fate was little to him, so that
the King of England was worried and distressed.&nbsp; Therefore, 
King Philip went his way into Normandy and Prince Arthur went his
way towards Mirebeau, a French town near Poictiers, both very 
well pleased.</p>
<p>Prince Arthur went to attack the town of Mirebeau, because his
grandmother Eleanor, who has so often made her appearance in this
history (and who had always been his mother&rsquo;s enemy), was 
living there, and because his Knights said, &lsquo;Prince, if you
can take her prisoner, you will be able to bring the King your 
uncle to terms!&rsquo;&nbsp; But she was not to be easily 
taken.&nbsp; She was old enough by this 
time&mdash;eighty&mdash;but she was as full of stratagem as she 
was full of years and wickedness.&nbsp; Receiving intelligence of
young Arthur&rsquo;s approach, she shut herself up in a high 
tower, and encouraged her soldiers to defend it like men.&nbsp; 
Prince Arthur with his little army besieged the high tower.&nbsp;
King John, hearing how matters stood, came up to the rescue, with
<i>his</i> army.&nbsp; So here was a strange family-party!&nbsp; 
The boy-Prince besieging his grandmother, and his uncle besieging
him!</p>
<p>This position of affairs did not last long.&nbsp; One summer 
night King John, by treachery, got his men into the town, 
surprised Prince Arthur&rsquo;s force, took two hundred of his 
knights, and seized the Prince himself in his bed.&nbsp; The 
Knights were put in heavy irons, and driven away in open carts 
drawn by bullocks, to various dungeons where they were most 
inhumanly treated, and where some of them were starved to 
death.&nbsp; Prince Arthur was sent to the castle of Falaise.</p>
<p>One day, while he was in prison at that castle, mournfully 
thinking it strange that one so young should be in so much 
trouble, and looking out of the small window in the deep dark 
wall, at the summer sky and the birds, the door was softly 
opened, and he saw his uncle the King standing in the shadow of 
the archway, looking very grim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arthur,&rsquo; said the King, with his wicked eyes more
on the stone floor than on his nephew, &lsquo;will you not trust 
to the gentleness, the friendship, and the truthfulness of your 
loving uncle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell my loving uncle that,&rsquo; replied the 
boy, &lsquo;when he does me right.&nbsp; Let him restore to me my
kingdom of England, and then come to me and ask the 
question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King looked at him and went out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep that 
boy close prisoner,&rsquo; said he to the warden of the 
castle.</p>
<p>Then, the King took secret counsel with the worst of his 
nobles how the Prince was to be got rid of.&nbsp; Some said, 
&lsquo;Put out his eyes and keep him in prison, as Robort of 
Normandy was kept.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others said, &lsquo;Have him 
stabbed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others, &lsquo;Have him 
hanged.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others, &lsquo;Have him poisoned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>King John, feeling that in any case, whatever was done 
afterwards, it would be a satisfaction to his mind to have those 
handsome eyes burnt out that had looked at him so proudly while 
his own royal eyes were blinking at the stone floor, sent certain
ruffians to Falaise to blind the boy with red-hot irons.&nbsp; 
But Arthur so pathetically entreated them, and shed such piteous 
tears, and so appealed to <span class="smcap">Hubert de 
Bourg</span> (or <span class="smcap">Burgh</span>), the warden of
the castle, who had a love for him, and was an honourable, tender
man, that Hubert could not bear it.&nbsp; To his eternal honour 
he prevented the torture from being performed, and, at his own 
risk, sent the savages away.</p>
<p>The chafed and disappointed King bethought himself of the 
stabbing suggestion next, and, with his shuffling manner and his 
cruel face, proposed it to one William de Bray.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
a gentleman and not an executioner,&rsquo; said William de Bray, 
and left the presence with disdain.</p>
<p>But it was not difficult for a King to hire a murderer in 
those days.&nbsp; King John found one for his money, and sent him
down to the castle of Falaise.&nbsp; &lsquo;On what errand dost 
thou come?&rsquo; said Hubert to this fellow.&nbsp; &lsquo;To 
despatch young Arthur,&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go back 
to him who sent thee,&rsquo; answered Hubert, &lsquo;and say that
I will do it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>King John very well knowing that Hubert would never do it, but
that he courageously sent this reply to save the Prince or gain 
time, despatched messengers to convey the young prisoner to the 
castle of Rouen.</p>
<p>Arthur was soon forced from the good Hubert&mdash;of whom he 
had never stood in greater need than then&mdash;carried away by 
night, and lodged in his new prison: where, through his grated 
window, he could hear the deep waters of the river Seine, 
rippling against the stone wall below.</p>
<p>One dark night, as he lay sleeping, dreaming perhaps of rescue
by those unfortunate gentlemen who were obscurely suffering and 
dying in his cause, he was roused, and bidden by his jailer to 
come down the staircase to the foot of the tower.&nbsp; He 
hurriedly dressed himself and obeyed.&nbsp; When they came to the
bottom of the winding stairs, and the night air from the river 
blew upon their faces, the jailer trod upon his torch and put it 
out.&nbsp; Then, Arthur, in the darkness, was hurriedly drawn 
into a solitary boat.&nbsp; And in that boat, he found his uncle 
and one other man.</p>
<p>He knelt to them, and prayed them not to murder him.&nbsp; 
Deaf to his entreaties, they stabbed him and sunk his body in the
river with heavy stones.&nbsp; When the spring-morning broke, the
tower-door was closed, the boat was gone, the river sparkled on 
its way, and never more was any trace of the poor boy beheld by 
mortal eyes.</p>
<p>The news of this atrocious murder being spread in England, 
awakened a hatred of the King (already odious for his many vices,
and for his having stolen away and married a noble lady while his
own wife was living) that never slept again through his whole 
reign.&nbsp; In Brittany, the indignation was intense.&nbsp; 
Arthur&rsquo;s own sister <span class="smcap">Eleanor</span> was 
in the power of John and shut up in a convent at Bristol, but his
half-sister <span class="smcap">Alice</span> was in 
Brittany.&nbsp; The people chose her, and the murdered 
prince&rsquo;s father-in-law, the last husband of Constance, to 
represent them; and carried their fiery complaints to King 
Philip.&nbsp; King Philip summoned King John (as the holder of 
territory in France) to come before him and defend himself.&nbsp;
King John refusing to appear, King Philip declared him false, 
perjured, and guilty; and again made war.&nbsp; In a little time,
by conquering the greater part of his French territory, King 
Philip deprived him of one-third of his dominions.&nbsp; And, 
through all the fighting that took place, King John was always 
found, either to be eating and drinking, like a gluttonous fool, 
when the danger was at a distance, or to be running away, like a 
beaten cur, when it was near.</p>
<p>You might suppose that when he was losing his dominions at 
this rate, and when his own nobles cared so little for him or his
cause that they plainly refused to follow his banner out of 
England, he had enemies enough.&nbsp; But he made another enemy 
of the Pope, which he did in this way.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury dying, and the junior monks of 
that place wishing to get the start of the senior monks in the 
appointment of his successor, met together at midnight, secretly 
elected a certain <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>, and sent 
him off to Rome to get the Pope&rsquo;s approval.&nbsp; The 
senior monks and the King soon finding this out, and being very 
angry about it, the junior monks gave way, and all the monks 
together elected the Bishop of Norwich, who was the King&rsquo;s 
favourite.&nbsp; The Pope, hearing the whole story, declared that
neither election would do for him, and that <i>he</i> elected 
<span class="smcap">Stephen Langton</span>.&nbsp; The monks 
submitting to the Pope, the King turned them all out bodily, and 
banished them as traitors.&nbsp; The Pope sent three bishops to 
the King, to threaten him with an Interdict.&nbsp; The King told 
the bishops that if any Interdict were laid upon his kingdom, he 
would tear out the eyes and cut off the noses of all the monks he
could lay hold of, and send them over to Rome in that undecorated
state as a present for their master.&nbsp; The bishops, 
nevertheless, soon published the Interdict, and fled.</p>
<p>After it had lasted a year, the Pope proceeded to his next 
step; which was Excommunication.&nbsp; King John was declared 
excommunicated, with all the usual ceremonies.&nbsp; The King was
so incensed at this, and was made so desperate by the 
disaffection of his Barons and the hatred of his people, that it 
is said he even privately sent ambassadors to the Turks in Spain,
offering to renounce his religion and hold his kingdom of them if
they would help him.&nbsp; It is related that the ambassadors 
were admitted to the presence of the Turkish Emir through long 
lines of Moorish guards, and that they found the Emir with his 
eyes seriously fixed on the pages of a large book, from which he 
never once looked up.&nbsp; That they gave him a letter from the 
King containing his proposals, and were gravely dismissed.&nbsp; 
That presently the Emir sent for one of them, and conjured him, 
by his faith in his religion, to say what kind of man the King of
England truly was?&nbsp; That the ambassador, thus pressed, 
replied that the King of England was a false tyrant, against whom
his own subjects would soon rise.&nbsp; And that this was quite 
enough for the Emir.</p>
<p>Money being, in his position, the next best thing to men, King
John spared no means of getting it.&nbsp; He set on foot another 
oppressing and torturing of the unhappy Jews (which was quite in 
his way), and invented a new punishment for one wealthy Jew of 
Bristol.&nbsp; Until such time as that Jew should produce a 
certain large sum of money, the King sentenced him to be 
imprisoned, and, every day, to have one tooth violently wrenched 
out of his head&mdash;beginning with the double teeth.&nbsp; For 
seven days, the oppressed man bore the daily pain and lost the 
daily tooth; but, on the eighth, he paid the money.&nbsp; With 
the treasure raised in such ways, the King made an expedition 
into Ireland, where some English nobles had revolted.&nbsp; It 
was one of the very few places from which he did not run away; 
because no resistance was shown.&nbsp; He made another expedition
into Wales&mdash;whence he <i>did</i> run away in the end: but 
not before he had got from the Welsh people, as hostages, 
twenty-seven young men of the best families; every one of whom he
caused to be slain in the following year.</p>
<p>To Interdict and Excommunication, the Pope now added his last 
sentence; Deposition.&nbsp; He proclaimed John no longer King, 
absolved all his subjects from their allegiance, and sent Stephen
Langton and others to the King of France to tell him that, if he 
would invade England, he should be forgiven all his sins&mdash;at
least, should be forgiven them by the Pope, if that would do.</p>
<p>As there was nothing that King Philip desired more than to 
invade England, he collected a great army at Rouen, and a fleet 
of seventeen hundred ships to bring them over.&nbsp; But the 
English people, however bitterly they hated the King, were not a 
people to suffer invasion quietly.&nbsp; They flocked to Dover, 
where the English standard was, in such great numbers to enrol 
themselves as defenders of their native land, that there were not
provisions for them, and the King could only select and retain 
sixty thousand.&nbsp; But, at this crisis, the Pope, who had his 
own reasons for objecting to either King John or King Philip 
being too powerful, interfered.&nbsp; He entrusted a legate, 
whose name was <span class="smcap">Pandolf</span>, with the easy 
task of frightening King John.&nbsp; He sent him to the English 
Camp, from France, to terrify him with exaggerations of King 
Philip&rsquo;s power, and his own weakness in the discontent of 
the English Barons and people.&nbsp; Pandolf discharged his 
commission so well, that King John, in a wretched panic, 
consented to acknowledge Stephen Langton; to resign his kingdom 
&lsquo;to God, Saint Peter, and Saint Paul&rsquo;&mdash;which 
meant the Pope; and to hold it, ever afterwards, by the 
Pope&rsquo;s leave, on payment of an annual sum of money.&nbsp; 
To this shameful contract he publicly bound himself in the church
of the Knights Templars at Dover: where he laid at the 
legate&rsquo;s feet a part of the tribute, which the legate 
haughtily trampled upon.&nbsp; But they <i>do</i> say, that this 
was merely a genteel flourish, and that he was afterwards seen to
pick it up and pocket it.</p>
<p>There was an unfortunate prophet, the name of Peter, who had 
greatly increased King John&rsquo;s terrors by predicting that he
would be unknighted (which the King supposed to signify that he 
would die) before the Feast of the Ascension should be 
past.&nbsp; That was the day after this humiliation.&nbsp; When 
the next morning came, and the King, who had been trembling all 
night, found himself alive and safe, he ordered the 
prophet&mdash;and his son too&mdash;to be dragged through the 
streets at the tails of horses, and then hanged, for having 
frightened him.</p>
<p>As King John had now submitted, the Pope, to King 
Philip&rsquo;s great astonishment, took him under his protection,
and informed King Philip that he found he could not give him 
leave to invade England.&nbsp; The angry Philip resolved to do it
without his leave but he gained nothing and lost much; for, the 
English, commanded by the Earl of Salisbury, went over, in five 
hundred ships, to the French coast, before the French fleet had 
sailed away from it, and utterly defeated the whole.</p>
<p>The Pope then took off his three sentences, one after another,
and empowered Stephen Langton publicly to receive King John into 
the favour of the Church again, and to ask him to dinner.&nbsp; 
The King, who hated Langton with all his might and main&mdash;and
with reason too, for he was a great and a good man, with whom 
such a King could have no sympathy&mdash;pretended to cry and to 
be <i>very</i> grateful.&nbsp; There was a little difficulty 
about settling how much the King should pay as a recompense to 
the clergy for the losses he had caused them; but, the end of it 
was, that the superior clergy got a good deal, and the inferior 
clergy got little or nothing&mdash;which has also happened since 
King John&rsquo;s time, I believe.</p>
<p>When all these matters were arranged, the King in his triumph 
became more fierce, and false, and insolent to all around him 
than he had ever been.&nbsp; An alliance of sovereigns against 
King Philip, gave him an opportunity of landing an army in 
France; with which he even took a town!&nbsp; But, on the French 
King&rsquo;s gaining a great victory, he ran away, of course, and
made a truce for five years.</p>
<p>And now the time approached when he was to be still further 
humbled, and made to feel, if he could feel anything, what a 
wretched creature he was.&nbsp; Of all men in the world, Stephen 
Langton seemed raised up by Heaven to oppose and subdue 
him.&nbsp; When he ruthlessly burnt and destroyed the property of
his own subjects, because their Lords, the Barons, would not 
serve him abroad, Stephen Langton fearlessly reproved and 
threatened him.&nbsp; When he swore to restore the laws of King 
Edward, or the laws of King Henry the First, Stephen Langton knew
his falsehood, and pursued him through all his evasions.&nbsp; 
When the Barons met at the abbey of Saint Edmund&rsquo;s-Bury, to
consider their wrongs and the King&rsquo;s oppressions, Stephen 
Langton roused them by his fervid words to demand a solemn 
charter of rights and liberties from their perjured master, and 
to swear, one by one, on the High Altar, that they would have it,
or would wage war against him to the death.&nbsp; When the King 
hid himself in London from the Barons, and was at last obliged to
receive them, they told him roundly they would not believe him 
unless Stephen Langton became a surety that he would keep his 
word.&nbsp; When he took the Cross to invest himself with some 
interest, and belong to something that was received with favour, 
Stephen Langton was still immovable.&nbsp; When he appealed to 
the Pope, and the Pope wrote to Stephen Langton in behalf of his 
new favourite, Stephen Langton was deaf, even to the Pope 
himself, and saw before him nothing but the welfare of England 
and the crimes of the English King.</p>
<p>At Easter-time, the Barons assembled at Stamford, in 
Lincolnshire, in proud array, and, marching near to Oxford where 
the King was, delivered into the hands of Stephen Langton and two
others, a list of grievances.&nbsp; &lsquo;And these,&rsquo; they
said, &lsquo;he must redress, or we will do it for 
ourselves!&rsquo;&nbsp; When Stephen Langton told the King as 
much, and read the list to him, he went half mad with rage.&nbsp;
But that did him no more good than his afterwards trying to 
pacify the Barons with lies.&nbsp; They called themselves and 
their followers, &lsquo;The army of God and the Holy 
Church.&rsquo;&nbsp; Marching through the country, with the 
people thronging to them everywhere (except at Northampton, where
they failed in an attack upon the castle), they at last 
triumphantly set up their banner in London itself, whither the 
whole land, tired of the tyrant, seemed to flock to join 
them.&nbsp; Seven knights alone, of all the knights in England, 
remained with the King; who, reduced to this strait, at last sent
the Earl of Pembroke to the Barons to say that he approved of 
everything, and would meet them to sign their charter when they 
would.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Barons, &lsquo;let the 
day be the fifteenth of June, and the place, 
Runny-Mead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fifteenth of June, one thousand two hundred and
fourteen, the King came from Windsor Castle, and the Barons came 
from the town of Staines, and they met on Runny-Mead, which is 
still a pleasant meadow by the Thames, where rushes grow in the 
clear water of the winding river, and its banks are green with 
grass and trees.&nbsp; On the side of the Barons, came the 
General of their army, <span class="smcap">Robert 
Fitz-Walter</span>, and a great concourse of the nobility of 
England.&nbsp; With the King, came, in all, some four-and-twenty 
persons of any note, most of whom despised him, and were merely 
his advisers in form.&nbsp; On that great day, and in that great 
company, the King signed <span class="smcap">Magna 
Charta</span>&mdash;the great charter of England&mdash;by which 
he pledged himself to maintain the Church in its rights; to 
relieve the Barons of oppressive obligations as vassals of the 
Crown&mdash;of which the Barons, in their turn, pledged 
themselves to relieve <i>their</i> vassals, the people; to 
respect the liberties of London and all other cities and 
boroughs; to protect foreign merchants who came to England; to 
imprison no man without a fair trial; and to sell, delay, or deny
justice to none.&nbsp; As the Barons knew his falsehood well, 
they further required, as their securities, that he should send 
out of his kingdom all his foreign troops; that for two months 
they should hold possession of the city of London, and Stephen 
Langton of the Tower; and that five-and-twenty of their body, 
chosen by themselves, should be a lawful committee to watch the 
keeping of the charter, and to make war upon him if he broke 
it.</p>
<p>All this he was obliged to yield.&nbsp; He signed the charter 
with a smile, and, if he could have looked agreeable, would have 
done so, as he departed from the splendid assembly.&nbsp; When he
got home to Windsor Castle, he was quite a madman in his helpless
fury.&nbsp; And he broke the charter immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>He sent abroad for foreign soldiers, and sent to the Pope for 
help, and plotted to take London by surprise, while the Barons 
should be holding a great tournament at Stamford, which they had 
agreed to hold there as a celebration of the charter.&nbsp; The 
Barons, however, found him out and put it off.&nbsp; Then, when 
the Barons desired to see him and tax him with his treachery, he 
made numbers of appointments with them, and kept none, and 
shifted from place to place, and was constantly sneaking and 
skulking about.&nbsp; At last he appeared at Dover, to join his 
foreign soldiers, of whom numbers came into his pay; and with 
them he besieged and took Rochester Castle, which was occupied by
knights and soldiers of the Barons.&nbsp; He would have hanged 
them every one; but the leader of the foreign soldiers, fearful 
of what the English people might afterwards do to him, interfered
to save the knights; therefore the King was fain to satisfy his 
vengeance with the death of all the common men.&nbsp; Then, he 
sent the Earl of Salisbury, with one portion of his army, to 
ravage the eastern part of his own dominions, while he carried 
fire and slaughter into the northern part; torturing, plundering,
killing, and inflicting every possible cruelty upon the people; 
and, every morning, setting a worthy example to his men by 
setting fire, with his own monster-hands, to the house where he 
had slept last night.&nbsp; Nor was this all; for the Pope, 
coming to the aid of his precious friend, laid the kingdom under 
an Interdict again, because the people took part with the 
Barons.&nbsp; It did not much matter, for the people had grown so
used to it now, that they had begun to think nothing about 
it.&nbsp; It occurred to them&mdash;perhaps to Stephen Langton 
too&mdash;that they could keep their churches open, and ring 
their bells, without the Pope&rsquo;s permission as well as with 
it.&nbsp; So, they tried the experiment&mdash;and found that it 
succeeded perfectly.</p>
<p>It being now impossible to bear the country, as a wilderness 
of cruelty, or longer to hold any terms with such a forsworn 
outlaw of a King, the Barons sent to Louis, son of the French 
monarch, to offer him the English crown.&nbsp; Caring as little 
for the Pope&rsquo;s excommunication of him if he accepted the 
offer, as it is possible his father may have cared for the 
Pope&rsquo;s forgiveness of his sins, he landed at Sandwich (King
John immediately running away from Dover, where he happened to 
be), and went on to London.&nbsp; The Scottish King, with whom 
many of the Northern English Lords had taken refuge; numbers of 
the foreign soldiers, numbers of the Barons, and numbers of the 
people went over to him every day;&mdash;King John, the while, 
continually running away in all directions.</p>
<p>The career of Louis was checked however, by the suspicions of 
the Barons, founded on the dying declaration of a French Lord, 
that when the kingdom was conquered he was sworn to banish them 
as traitors, and to give their estates to some of his own 
Nobles.&nbsp; Rather than suffer this, some of the Barons 
hesitated: others even went over to King John.</p>
<p>It seemed to be the turning-point of King John&rsquo;s 
fortunes, for, in his savage and murderous course, he had now 
taken some towns and met with some successes.&nbsp; But, happily 
for England and humanity, his death was near.&nbsp; Crossing a 
dangerous quicksand, called the Wash, not very far from Wisbeach,
the tide came up and nearly drowned his army.&nbsp; He and his 
soldiers escaped; but, looking back from the shore when he was 
safe, he saw the roaring water sweep down in a torrent, overturn 
the waggons, horses, and men, that carried his treasure, and 
engulf them in a raging whirlpool from which nothing could be 
delivered.</p>
<p>Cursing, and swearing, and gnawing his fingers, he went on to 
Swinestead Abbey, where the monks set before him quantities of 
pears, and peaches, and new cider&mdash;some say poison too, but 
there is very little reason to suppose so&mdash;of which he ate 
and drank in an immoderate and beastly way.&nbsp; All night he 
lay ill of a burning fever, and haunted with horrible 
fears.&nbsp; Next day, they put him in a horse-litter, and 
carried him to Sleaford Castle, where he passed another night of 
pain and horror.&nbsp; Next day, they carried him, with greater 
difficulty than on the day before, to the castle of Newark upon 
Trent; and there, on the eighteenth of October, in the 
forty-ninth year of his age, and the seventeenth of his vile 
reign, was an end of this miserable brute.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE THIRD, CALLED, OF 
WINCHESTER</h2>
<p>If any of the English Barons remembered the murdered 
Arthur&rsquo;s sister, Eleanor the fair maid of Brittany, shut up
in her convent at Bristol, none among them spoke of her now, or 
maintained her right to the Crown.&nbsp; The dead Usurper&rsquo;s
eldest boy, <span class="smcap">Henry</span> by name, was taken 
by the Earl of Pembroke, the Marshal of England, to the city of 
Gloucester, and there crowned in great haste when he was only ten
years old.&nbsp; As the Crown itself had been lost with the 
King&rsquo;s treasure in the raging water, and as there was no 
time to make another, they put a circle of plain gold upon his 
head instead.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have been the enemies of this 
child&rsquo;s father,&rsquo; said Lord Pembroke, a good and true 
gentleman, to the few Lords who were present, &lsquo;and he 
merited our ill-will; but the child himself is innocent, and his 
youth demands our friendship and protection.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those 
Lords felt tenderly towards the little boy, remembering their own
young children; and they bowed their heads, and said, &lsquo;Long
live King Henry the Third!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next, a great council met at Bristol, revised Magna Charta, 
and made Lord Pembroke Regent or Protector of England, as the 
King was too young to reign alone.&nbsp; The next thing to be 
done, was to get rid of Prince Louis of France, and to win over 
those English Barons who were still ranged under his 
banner.&nbsp; He was strong in many parts of England, and in 
London itself; and he held, among other places, a certain Castle 
called the Castle of Mount Sorel, in Leicestershire.&nbsp; To 
this fortress, after some skirmishing and truce-making, Lord 
Pembroke laid siege.&nbsp; Louis despatched an army of six 
hundred knights and twenty thousand soldiers to relieve it.&nbsp;
Lord Pembroke, who was not strong enough for such a force, 
retired with all his men.&nbsp; The army of the French Prince, 
which had marched there with fire and plunder, marched away with 
fire and plunder, and came, in a boastful swaggering manner, to 
Lincoln.&nbsp; The town submitted; but the Castle in the town, 
held by a brave widow lady, named <span class="smcap">Nichola de 
Camville</span> (whose property it was), made such a sturdy 
resistance, that the French Count in command of the army of the 
French Prince found it necessary to besiege this Castle.&nbsp; 
While he was thus engaged, word was brought to him that Lord 
Pembroke, with four hundred knights, two hundred and fifty men 
with cross-bows, and a stout force both of horse and foot, was 
marching towards him.&nbsp; &lsquo;What care I?&rsquo; said the 
French Count.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Englishman is not so mad as to 
attack me and my great army in a walled town!&rsquo;&nbsp; But 
the Englishman did it for all that, and did it&mdash;not so madly
but so wisely, that he decoyed the great army into the narrow, 
ill-paved lanes and byways of Lincoln, where its horse-soldiers 
could not ride in any strong body; and there he made such havoc 
with them, that the whole force surrendered themselves prisoners,
except the Count; who said that he would never yield to any 
English traitor alive, and accordingly got killed.&nbsp; The end 
of this victory, which the English called, for a joke, the Fair 
of Lincoln, was the usual one in those times&mdash;the common men
were slain without any mercy, and the knights and gentlemen paid 
ransom and went home.</p>
<p>The wife of Louis, the fair <span class="smcap">Blanche of 
Castile</span>, dutifully equipped a fleet of eighty good ships, 
and sent it over from France to her husband&rsquo;s aid.&nbsp; An
English fleet of forty ships, some good and some bad, gallantly 
met them near the mouth of the Thames, and took or sunk 
sixty-five in one fight.&nbsp; This great loss put an end to the 
French Prince&rsquo;s hopes.&nbsp; A treaty was made at Lambeth, 
in virtue of which the English Barons who had remained attached 
to his cause returned to their allegiance, and it was engaged on 
both sides that the Prince and all his troops should retire 
peacefully to France.&nbsp; It was time to go; for war had made 
him so poor that he was obliged to borrow money from the citizens
of London to pay his expenses home.</p>
<p>Lord Pembroke afterwards applied himself to governing the 
country justly, and to healing the quarrels and disturbances that
had arisen among men in the days of the bad King John.&nbsp; He 
caused Magna Charta to be still more improved, and so amended the
Forest Laws that a Peasant was no longer put to death for killing
a stag in a Royal Forest, but was only imprisoned.&nbsp; It would
have been well for England if it could have had so good a 
Protector many years longer, but that was not to be.&nbsp; Within
three years after the young King&rsquo;s Coronation, Lord 
Pembroke died; and you may see his tomb, at this day, in the old 
Temple Church in London.</p>
<p>The Protectorship was now divided.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Peter de Roches</span>, whom King John had made 
Bishop of Winchester, was entrusted with the care of the person 
of the young sovereign; and the exercise of the Royal authority 
was confided to <span class="smcap">Earl Hubert de 
Burgh</span>.&nbsp; These two personages had from the first no 
liking for each other, and soon became enemies.&nbsp; When the 
young King was declared of age, Peter de Roches, finding that 
Hubert increased in power and favour, retired discontentedly, and
went abroad.&nbsp; For nearly ten years afterwards Hubert had 
full sway alone.</p>
<p>But ten years is a long time to hold the favour of a 
King.&nbsp; This King, too, as he grew up, showed a strong 
resemblance to his father, in feebleness, inconsistency, and 
irresolution.&nbsp; The best that can be said of him is that he 
was not cruel.&nbsp; De Roches coming home again, after ten 
years, and being a novelty, the King began to favour him and to 
look coldly on Hubert.&nbsp; Wanting money besides, and having 
made Hubert rich, he began to dislike Hubert.&nbsp; At last he 
was made to believe, or pretended to believe, that Hubert had 
misappropriated some of the Royal treasure; and ordered him to 
furnish an account of all he had done in his 
administration.&nbsp; Besides which, the foolish charge was 
brought against Hubert that he had made himself the King&rsquo;s 
favourite by magic.&nbsp; Hubert very well knowing that he could 
never defend himself against such nonsense, and that his old 
enemy must be determined on his ruin, instead of answering the 
charges fled to Merton Abbey.&nbsp; Then the King, in a violent 
passion, sent for the Mayor of London, and said to the Mayor, 
&lsquo;Take twenty thousand citizens, and drag me Hubert de Burgh
out of that abbey, and bring him here.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Mayor 
posted off to do it, but the Archbishop of Dublin (who was a 
friend of Hubert&rsquo;s) warning the King that an abbey was a 
sacred place, and that if he committed any violence there, he 
must answer for it to the Church, the King changed his mind and 
called the Mayor back, and declared that Hubert should have four 
months to prepare his defence, and should be safe and free during
that time.</p>
<p>Hubert, who relied upon the King&rsquo;s word, though I think 
he was old enough to have known better, came out of Merton Abbey 
upon these conditions, and journeyed away to see his wife: a 
Scottish Princess who was then at St. Edmund&rsquo;s-Bury.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he had departed from the Sanctuary, his 
enemies persuaded the weak King to send out one <span 
class="smcap">Sir Godfrey de Crancumb</span>, who commanded three
hundred vagabonds called the Black Band, with orders to seize 
him.&nbsp; They came up with him at a little town in Essex, 
called Brentwood, when he was in bed.&nbsp; He leaped out of bed,
got out of the house, fled to the church, ran up to the altar, 
and laid his hand upon the cross.&nbsp; Sir Godfrey and the Black
Band, caring neither for church, altar, nor cross, dragged him 
forth to the church door, with their drawn swords flashing round 
his head, and sent for a Smith to rivet a set of chains upon 
him.&nbsp; When the Smith (I wish I knew his name!) was brought, 
all dark and swarthy with the smoke of his forge, and panting 
with the speed he had made; and the Black Band, falling aside to 
show him the Prisoner, cried with a loud uproar, &lsquo;Make the 
fetters heavy! make them strong!&rsquo; the Smith dropped upon 
his knee&mdash;but not to the Black Band&mdash;and said, 
&lsquo;This is the brave Earl Hubert de Burgh, who fought at 
Dover Castle, and destroyed the French fleet, and has done his 
country much good service.&nbsp; You may kill me, if you like, 
but I will never make a chain for Earl Hubert de 
Burgh!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Black Band never blushed, or they might have blushed at 
this.&nbsp; They knocked the Smith about from one to another, and
swore at him, and tied the Earl on horseback, undressed as he 
was, and carried him off to the Tower of London.&nbsp; The 
Bishops, however, were so indignant at the violation of the 
Sanctuary of the Church, that the frightened King soon ordered 
the Black Band to take him back again; at the same time 
commanding the Sheriff of Essex to prevent his escaping out of 
Brentwood Church.&nbsp; Well! the Sheriff dug a deep trench all 
round the church, and erected a high fence, and watched the 
church night and day; the Black Band and their Captain watched it
too, like three hundred and one black wolves.&nbsp; For 
thirty-nine days, Hubert de Burgh remained within.&nbsp; At 
length, upon the fortieth day, cold and hunger were too much for 
him, and he gave himself up to the Black Band, who carried him 
off, for the second time, to the Tower.&nbsp; When his trial came
on, he refused to plead; but at last it was arranged that he 
should give up all the royal lands which had been bestowed upon 
him, and should be kept at the Castle of Devizes, in what was 
called &lsquo;free prison,&rsquo; in charge of four knights 
appointed by four lords.&nbsp; There, he remained almost a year, 
until, learning that a follower of his old enemy the Bishop was 
made Keeper of the Castle, and fearing that he might be killed by
treachery, he climbed the ramparts one dark night, dropped from 
the top of the high Castle wall into the moat, and coming safely 
to the ground, took refuge in another church.&nbsp; From this 
place he was delivered by a party of horse despatched to his help
by some nobles, who were by this time in revolt against the King,
and assembled in Wales.&nbsp; He was finally pardoned and 
restored to his estates, but he lived privately, and never more 
aspired to a high post in the realm, or to a high place in the 
King&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; And thus end&mdash;more happily than 
the stories of many favourites of Kings&mdash;the adventures of 
Earl Hubert de Burgh.</p>
<p>The nobles, who had risen in revolt, were stirred up to 
rebellion by the overbearing conduct of the Bishop of Winchester,
who, finding that the King secretly hated the Great Charter which
had been forced from his father, did his utmost to confirm him in
that dislike, and in the preference he showed to foreigners over 
the English.&nbsp; Of this, and of his even publicly declaring 
that the Barons of England were inferior to those of France, the 
English Lords complained with such bitterness, that the King, 
finding them well supported by the clergy, became frightened for 
his throne, and sent away the Bishop and all his foreign 
associates.&nbsp; On his marriage, however, with <span 
class="smcap">Eleanor</span>, a French lady, the daughter of the 
Count of Provence, he openly favoured the foreigners again; and 
so many of his wife&rsquo;s relations came over, and made such an
immense family-party at court, and got so many good things, and 
pocketed so much money, and were so high with the English whose 
money they pocketed, that the bolder English Barons murmured 
openly about a clause there was in the Great Charter, which 
provided for the banishment of unreasonable favourites.&nbsp; 
But, the foreigners only laughed disdainfully, and said, 
&lsquo;What are your English laws to us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>King Philip of France had died, and had been succeeded by 
Prince Louis, who had also died after a short reign of three 
years, and had been succeeded by his son of the same 
name&mdash;so moderate and just a man that he was not the least 
in the world like a King, as Kings went.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Isabella</span>, King Henry&rsquo;s mother, wished 
very much (for a certain spite she had) that England should make 
war against this King; and, as King Henry was a mere puppet in 
anybody&rsquo;s hands who knew how to manage his feebleness, she 
easily carried her point with him.&nbsp; But, the Parliament were
determined to give him no money for such a war.&nbsp; So, to defy
the Parliament, he packed up thirty large casks of silver&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know how he got so much; I dare say he screwed it out
of the miserable Jews&mdash;and put them aboard ship, and went 
away himself to carry war into France: accompanied by his mother 
and his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who was rich and 
clever.&nbsp; But he only got well beaten, and came home.</p>
<p>The good-humour of the Parliament was not restored by 
this.&nbsp; They reproached the King with wasting the public 
money to make greedy foreigners rich, and were so stern with him,
and so determined not to let him have more of it to waste if they
could help it, that he was at his wit&rsquo;s end for some, and 
tried so shamelessly to get all he could from his subjects, by 
excuses or by force, that the people used to say the King was the
sturdiest beggar in England.&nbsp; He took the Cross, thinking to
get some money by that means; but, as it was very well known that
he never meant to go on a crusade, he got none.&nbsp; In all this
contention, the Londoners were particularly keen against the 
King, and the King hated them warmly in return.&nbsp; Hating or 
loving, however, made no difference; he continued in the same 
condition for nine or ten years, when at last the Barons said 
that if he would solemnly confirm their liberties afresh, the 
Parliament would vote him a large sum.</p>
<p>As he readily consented, there was a great meeting held in 
Westminster Hall, one pleasant day in May, when all the clergy, 
dressed in their robes and holding every one of them a burning 
candle in his hand, stood up (the Barons being also there) while 
the Archbishop of Canterbury read the sentence of excommunication
against any man, and all men, who should henceforth, in any way, 
infringe the Great Charter of the Kingdom.&nbsp; When he had 
done, they all put out their burning candles with a curse upon 
the soul of any one, and every one, who should merit that 
sentence.&nbsp; The King concluded with an oath to keep the 
Charter, &lsquo;As I am a man, as I am a Christian, as I am a 
Knight, as I am a King!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was easy to make oaths, and easy to break them; and the 
King did both, as his father had done before him.&nbsp; He took 
to his old courses again when he was supplied with money, and 
soon cured of their weakness the few who had ever really trusted 
him.&nbsp; When his money was gone, and he was once more 
borrowing and begging everywhere with a meanness worthy of his 
nature, he got into a difficulty with the Pope respecting the 
Crown of Sicily, which the Pope said he had a right to give away,
and which he offered to King Henry for his second son, <span 
class="smcap">Prince Edmund</span>.&nbsp; But, if you or I give 
away what we have not got, and what belongs to somebody else, it 
is likely that the person to whom we give it, will have some 
trouble in taking it.&nbsp; It was exactly so in this case.&nbsp;
It was necessary to conquer the Sicilian Crown before it could be
put upon young Edmund&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; It could not be 
conquered without money.&nbsp; The Pope ordered the clergy to 
raise money.&nbsp; The clergy, however, were not so obedient to 
him as usual; they had been disputing with him for some time 
about his unjust preference of Italian Priests in England; and 
they had begun to doubt whether the King&rsquo;s chaplain, whom 
he allowed to be paid for preaching in seven hundred churches, 
could possibly be, even by the Pope&rsquo;s favour, in seven 
hundred places at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Pope and the King 
together,&rsquo; said the Bishop of London, &lsquo;may take the 
mitre off my head; but, if they do, they will find that I shall 
put on a soldier&rsquo;s helmet.&nbsp; I pay 
nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bishop of Worcester was as bold as the 
Bishop of London, and would pay nothing either.&nbsp; Such sums 
as the more timid or more helpless of the clergy did raise were 
squandered away, without doing any good to the King, or bringing 
the Sicilian Crown an inch nearer to Prince Edmund&rsquo;s 
head.&nbsp; The end of the business was, that the Pope gave the 
Crown to the brother of the King of France (who conquered it for 
himself), and sent the King of England in, a bill of one hundred 
thousand pounds for the expenses of not having won it.</p>
<p>The King was now so much distressed that we might almost pity 
him, if it were possible to pity a King so shabby and 
ridiculous.&nbsp; His clever brother, Richard, had bought the 
title of King of the Romans from the German people, and was no 
longer near him, to help him with advice.&nbsp; The clergy, 
resisting the very Pope, were in alliance with the Barons.&nbsp; 
The Barons were headed by <span class="smcap">Simon de 
Montfort</span>, Earl of Leicester, married to King Henry&rsquo;s
sister, and, though a foreigner himself, the most popular man in 
England against the foreign favourites.&nbsp; When the King next 
met his Parliament, the Barons, led by this Earl, came before 
him, armed from head to foot, and cased in armour.&nbsp; When the
Parliament again assembled, in a month&rsquo;s time, at Oxford, 
this Earl was at their head, and the King was obliged to consent,
on oath, to what was called a Committee of Government: consisting
of twenty-four members: twelve chosen by the Barons, and twelve 
chosen by himself.</p>
<p>But, at a good time for him, his brother Richard came 
back.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s first act (the Barons would not admit
him into England on other terms) was to swear to be faithful to 
the Committee of Government&mdash;which he immediately began to 
oppose with all his might.&nbsp; Then, the Barons began to 
quarrel among themselves; especially the proud Earl of Gloucester
with the Earl of Leicester, who went abroad in disgust.&nbsp; 
Then, the people began to be dissatisfied with the Barons, 
because they did not do enough for them.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s 
chances seemed so good again at length, that he took heart 
enough&mdash;or caught it from his brother&mdash;to tell the 
Committee of Government that he abolished them&mdash;as to his 
oath, never mind that, the Pope said!&mdash;and to seize all the 
money in the Mint, and to shut himself up in the Tower of 
London.&nbsp; Here he was joined by his eldest son, Prince 
Edward; and, from the Tower, he made public a letter of the 
Pope&rsquo;s to the world in general, informing all men that he 
had been an excellent and just King for five-and-forty years.</p>
<p>As everybody knew he had been nothing of the sort, nobody 
cared much for this document.&nbsp; It so chanced that the proud 
Earl of Gloucester dying, was succeeded by his son; and that his 
son, instead of being the enemy of the Earl of Leicester, was 
(for the time) his friend.&nbsp; It fell out, therefore, that 
these two Earls joined their forces, took several of the Royal 
Castles in the country, and advanced as hard as they could on 
London.&nbsp; The London people, always opposed to the King, 
declared for them with great joy.&nbsp; The King himself remained
shut up, not at all gloriously, in the Tower.&nbsp; Prince Edward
made the best of his way to Windsor Castle.&nbsp; His mother, the
Queen, attempted to follow him by water; but, the people seeing 
her barge rowing up the river, and hating her with all their 
hearts, ran to London Bridge, got together a quantity of stones 
and mud, and pelted the barge as it came through, crying 
furiously, &lsquo;Drown the Witch!&nbsp; Drown her!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
They were so near doing it, that the Mayor took the old lady 
under his protection, and shut her up in St. Paul&rsquo;s until 
the danger was past.</p>
<p>It would require a great deal of writing on my part, and a 
great deal of reading on yours, to follow the King through his 
disputes with the Barons, and to follow the Barons through their 
disputes with one another&mdash;so I will make short work of it 
for both of us, and only relate the chief events that arose out 
of these quarrels.&nbsp; The good King of France was asked to 
decide between them.&nbsp; He gave it as his opinion that the 
King must maintain the Great Charter, and that the Barons must 
give up the Committee of Government, and all the rest that had 
been done by the Parliament at Oxford: which the Royalists, or 
King&rsquo;s party, scornfully called the Mad Parliament.&nbsp; 
The Barons declared that these were not fair terms, and they 
would not accept them.&nbsp; Then they caused the great bell of 
St. Paul&rsquo;s to be tolled, for the purpose of rousing up the 
London people, who armed themselves at the dismal sound and 
formed quite an army in the streets.&nbsp; I am sorry to say, 
however, that instead of falling upon the King&rsquo;s party with
whom their quarrel was, they fell upon the miserable Jews, and 
killed at least five hundred of them.&nbsp; They pretended that 
some of these Jews were on the King&rsquo;s side, and that they 
kept hidden in their houses, for the destruction of the people, a
certain terrible composition called Greek Fire, which could not 
be put out with water, but only burnt the fiercer for it.&nbsp; 
What they really did keep in their houses was money; and this 
their cruel enemies wanted, and this their cruel enemies took, 
like robbers and murderers.</p>
<p>The Earl of Leicester put himself at the head of these 
Londoners and other forces, and followed the King to Lewes in 
Sussex, where he lay encamped with his army.&nbsp; Before giving 
the King&rsquo;s forces battle here, the Earl addressed his 
soldiers, and said that King Henry the Third had broken so many 
oaths, that he had become the enemy of God, and therefore they 
would wear white crosses on their breasts, as if they were 
arrayed, not against a fellow-Christian, but against a 
Turk.&nbsp; White-crossed accordingly, they rushed into the 
fight.&nbsp; They would have lost the day&mdash;the King having 
on his side all the foreigners in England: and, from Scotland, 
<span class="smcap">John Comyn</span>, <span class="smcap">John 
Baliol</span>, and <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>, with 
all their men&mdash;but for the impatience of <span 
class="smcap">Prince Edward</span>, who, in his hot desire to 
have vengeance on the people of London, threw the whole of his 
father&rsquo;s army into confusion.&nbsp; He was taken Prisoner; 
so was the King; so was the King&rsquo;s brother the King of the 
Romans; and five thousand Englishmen were left dead upon the 
bloody grass.</p>
<p>For this success, the Pope excommunicated the Earl of 
Leicester: which neither the Earl nor the people cared at all 
about.&nbsp; The people loved him and supported him, and he 
became the real King; having all the power of the government in 
his own hands, though he was outwardly respectful to King Henry 
the Third, whom he took with him wherever he went, like a poor 
old limp court-card.&nbsp; He summoned a Parliament (in the year 
one thousand two hundred and sixty-five) which was the first 
Parliament in England that the people had any real share in 
electing; and he grew more and more in favour with the people 
every day, and they stood by him in whatever he did.</p>
<p>Many of the other Barons, and particularly the Earl of 
Gloucester, who had become by this time as proud as his father, 
grew jealous of this powerful and popular Earl, who was proud 
too, and began to conspire against him.&nbsp; Since the battle of
Lewes, Prince Edward had been kept as a hostage, and, though he 
was otherwise treated like a Prince, had never been allowed to go
out without attendants appointed by the Earl of Leicester, who 
watched him.&nbsp; The conspiring Lords found means to propose to
him, in secret, that they should assist him to escape, and should
make him their leader; to which he very heartily consented.</p>
<p>So, on a day that was agreed upon, he said to his attendants 
after dinner (being then at Hereford), &lsquo;I should like to 
ride on horseback, this fine afternoon, a little way into the 
country.&rsquo;&nbsp; As they, too, thought it would be very 
pleasant to have a canter in the sunshine, they all rode out of 
the town together in a gay little troop.&nbsp; When they came to 
a fine level piece of turf, the Prince fell to comparing their 
horses one with another, and offering bets that one was faster 
than another; and the attendants, suspecting no harm, rode 
galloping matches until their horses were quite tired.&nbsp; The 
Prince rode no matches himself, but looked on from his saddle, 
and staked his money.&nbsp; Thus they passed the whole merry 
afternoon.&nbsp; Now, the sun was setting, and they were all 
going slowly up a hill, the Prince&rsquo;s horse very fresh and 
all the other horses very weary, when a strange rider mounted on 
a grey steed appeared at the top of the hill, and waved his 
hat.&nbsp; &lsquo;What does the fellow mean?&rsquo; said the 
attendants one to another.&nbsp; The Prince answered on the 
instant by setting spurs to his horse, dashing away at his utmost
speed, joining the man, riding into the midst of a little crowd 
of horsemen who were then seen waiting under some trees, and who 
closed around him; and so he departed in a cloud of dust, leaving
the road empty of all but the baffled attendants, who sat looking
at one another, while their horses drooped their ears and 
panted.</p>
<p>The Prince joined the Earl of Gloucester at Ludlow.&nbsp; The 
Earl of Leicester, with a part of the army and the stupid old 
King, was at Hereford.&nbsp; One of the Earl of Leicester&rsquo;s
sons, Simon de Montfort, with another part of the army, was in 
Sussex.&nbsp; To prevent these two parts from uniting was the 
Prince&rsquo;s first object.&nbsp; He attacked Simon de Montfort 
by night, defeated him, seized his banners and treasure, and 
forced him into Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, which belonged
to his family.</p>
<p>His father, the Earl of Leicester, in the meanwhile, not 
knowing what had happened, marched out of Hereford, with his part
of the army and the King, to meet him.&nbsp; He came, on a bright
morning in August, to Evesham, which is watered by the pleasant 
river Avon.&nbsp; Looking rather anxiously across the prospect 
towards Kenilworth, he saw his own banners advancing; and his 
face brightened with joy.&nbsp; But, it clouded darkly when he 
presently perceived that the banners were captured, and in the 
enemy&rsquo;s hands; and he said, &lsquo;It is over.&nbsp; The 
Lord have mercy on our souls, for our bodies are Prince 
Edward&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He fought like a true Knight, nevertheless.&nbsp; When his 
horse was killed under him, he fought on foot.&nbsp; It was a 
fierce battle, and the dead lay in heaps everywhere.&nbsp; The 
old King, stuck up in a suit of armour on a big war-horse, which 
didn&rsquo;t mind him at all, and which carried him into all 
sorts of places where he didn&rsquo;t want to go, got into 
everybody&rsquo;s way, and very nearly got knocked on the head by
one of his son&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; But he managed to pipe out, 
&lsquo;I am Harry of Winchester!&rsquo; and the Prince, who heard
him, seized his bridle, and took him out of peril.&nbsp; The Earl
of Leicester still fought bravely, until his best son Henry was 
killed, and the bodies of his best friends choked his path; and 
then he fell, still fighting, sword in hand.&nbsp; They mangled 
his body, and sent it as a present to a noble lady&mdash;but a 
very unpleasant lady, I should think&mdash;who was the wife of 
his worst enemy.&nbsp; They could not mangle his memory in the 
minds of the faithful people, though.&nbsp; Many years 
afterwards, they loved him more than ever, and regarded him as a 
Saint, and always spoke of him as &lsquo;Sir Simon the 
Righteous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And even though he was dead, the cause for which he had fought
still lived, and was strong, and forced itself upon the King in 
the very hour of victory.&nbsp; Henry found himself obliged to 
respect the Great Charter, however much he hated it, and to make 
laws similar to the laws of the Great Earl of Leicester, and to 
be moderate and forgiving towards the people at last&mdash;even 
towards the people of London, who had so long opposed him.&nbsp; 
There were more risings before all this was done, but they were 
set at rest by these means, and Prince Edward did his best in all
things to restore peace.&nbsp; One Sir Adam de Gourdon was the 
last dissatisfied knight in arms; but, the Prince vanquished him 
in single combat, in a wood, and nobly gave him his life, and 
became his friend, instead of slaying him.&nbsp; Sir Adam was not
ungrateful.&nbsp; He ever afterwards remained devoted to his 
generous conqueror.</p>
<p>When the troubles of the Kingdom were thus calmed, Prince 
Edward and his cousin Henry took the Cross, and went away to the 
Holy Land, with many English Lords and Knights.&nbsp; Four years 
afterwards the King of the Romans died, and, next year (one 
thousand two hundred and seventy-two), his brother the weak King 
of England died.&nbsp; He was sixty-eight years old then, and had
reigned fifty-six years.&nbsp; He was as much of a King in death,
as he had ever been in life.&nbsp; He was the mere pale shadow of
a King at all times.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIRST, CALLED 
LONGSHANKS</h2>
<p>It was now the year of our Lord one thousand two hundred and 
seventy-two; and Prince Edward, the heir to the throne, being 
away in the Holy Land, knew nothing of his father&rsquo;s 
death.&nbsp; The Barons, however, proclaimed him King, 
immediately after the Royal funeral; and the people very 
willingly consented, since most men knew too well by this time 
what the horrors of a contest for the crown were.&nbsp; So King 
Edward the First, called, in a not very complimentary manner, 
<span class="smcap">Longshanks</span>, because of the slenderness
of his legs, was peacefully accepted by the English Nation.</p>
<p>His legs had need to be strong, however long and thin they 
were; for they had to support him through many difficulties on 
the fiery sands of Asia, where his small force of soldiers 
fainted, died, deserted, and seemed to melt away.&nbsp; But his 
prowess made light of it, and he said, &lsquo;I will go on, if I 
go on with no other follower than my groom!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Prince of this spirit gave the Turks a deal of 
trouble.&nbsp; He stormed Nazareth, at which place, of all places
on earth, I am sorry to relate, he made a frightful slaughter of 
innocent people; and then he went to Acre, where he got a truce 
of ten years from the Sultan.&nbsp; He had very nearly lost his 
life in Acre, through the treachery of a Saracen Noble, called 
the Emir of Jaffa, who, making the pretence that he had some idea
of turning Christian and wanted to know all about that religion, 
sent a trusty messenger to Edward very often&mdash;with a dagger 
in his sleeve.&nbsp; At last, one Friday in Whitsun week, when it
was very hot, and all the sandy prospect lay beneath the blazing 
sun, burnt up like a great overdone biscuit, and Edward was lying
on a couch, dressed for coolness in only a loose robe, the 
messenger, with his chocolate-coloured face and his bright dark 
eyes and white teeth, came creeping in with a letter, and kneeled
down like a tame tiger.&nbsp; But, the moment Edward stretched 
out his hand to take the letter, the tiger made a spring at his 
heart.&nbsp; He was quick, but Edward was quick too.&nbsp; He 
seized the traitor by his chocolate throat, threw him to the 
ground, and slew him with the very dagger he had drawn.&nbsp; The
weapon had struck Edward in the arm, and although the wound 
itself was slight, it threatened to be mortal, for the blade of 
the dagger had been smeared with poison.&nbsp; Thanks, however, 
to a better surgeon than was often to be found in those times, 
and to some wholesome herbs, and above all, to his faithful wife,
<span class="smcap">Eleanor</span>, who devotedly nursed him, and
is said by some to have sucked the poison from the wound with her
own red lips (which I am very willing to believe), Edward soon 
recovered and was sound again.</p>
<p>As the King his father had sent entreaties to him to return 
home, he now began the journey.&nbsp; He had got as far as Italy,
when he met messengers who brought him intelligence of the 
King&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Hearing that all was quiet at home, he 
made no haste to return to his own dominions, but paid a visit to
the Pope, and went in state through various Italian Towns, where 
he was welcomed with acclamations as a mighty champion of the 
Cross from the Holy Land, and where he received presents of 
purple mantles and prancing horses, and went along in great 
triumph.&nbsp; The shouting people little knew that he was the 
last English monarch who would ever embark in a crusade, or that 
within twenty years every conquest which the Christians had made 
in the Holy Land at the cost of so much blood, would be won back 
by the Turks.&nbsp; But all this came to pass.</p>
<p>There was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain in 
France, called Ch&acirc;lons.&nbsp; When the King was coming 
towards this place on his way to England, a wily French Lord, 
called the Count of Ch&acirc;lons, sent him a polite challenge to
come with his knights and hold a fair tournament with the Count 
and <i>his</i> knights, and make a day of it with sword and 
lance.&nbsp; It was represented to the King that the Count of 
Ch&acirc;lons was not to be trusted, and that, instead of a 
holiday fight for mere show and in good humour, he secretly meant
a real battle, in which the English should be defeated by 
superior force.</p>
<p>The King, however, nothing afraid, went to the appointed place
on the appointed day with a thousand followers.&nbsp; When the 
Count came with two thousand and attacked the English in earnest,
the English rushed at them with such valour that the 
Count&rsquo;s men and the Count&rsquo;s horses soon began to be 
tumbled down all over the field.&nbsp; The Count himself seized 
the King round the neck, but the King tumbled <i>him</i> out of 
his saddle in return for the compliment, and, jumping from his 
own horse, and standing over him, beat away at his iron armour 
like a blacksmith hammering on his anvil.&nbsp; Even when the 
Count owned himself defeated and offered his sword, the King 
would not do him the honour to take it, but made him yield it up 
to a common soldier.&nbsp; There had been such fury shown in this
fight, that it was afterwards called the little Battle of 
Ch&acirc;lons.</p>
<p>The English were very well disposed to be proud of their King 
after these adventures; so, when he landed at Dover in the year 
one thousand two hundred and seventy-four (being then thirty-six 
years old), and went on to Westminster where he and his good 
Queen were crowned with great magnificence, splendid rejoicings 
took place.&nbsp; For the coronation-feast there were provided, 
among other eatables, four hundred oxen, four hundred sheep, four
hundred and fifty pigs, eighteen wild boars, three hundred 
flitches of bacon, and twenty thousand fowls.&nbsp; The fountains
and conduits in the street flowed with red and white wine instead
of water; the rich citizens hung silks and cloths of the 
brightest colours out of their windows to increase the beauty of 
the show, and threw out gold and silver by whole handfuls to make
scrambles for the crowd.&nbsp; In short, there was such eating 
and drinking, such music and capering, such a ringing of bells 
and tossing of caps, such a shouting, and singing, and revelling,
as the narrow overhanging streets of old London City had not 
witnessed for many a long day.&nbsp; All the people were merry 
except the poor Jews, who, trembling within their houses, and 
scarcely daring to peep out, began to foresee that they would 
have to find the money for this joviality sooner or later.</p>
<p>To dismiss this sad subject of the Jews for the present, I am 
sorry to add that in this reign they were most unmercifully 
pillaged.&nbsp; They were hanged in great numbers, on accusations
of having clipped the King&rsquo;s coin&mdash;which all kinds of 
people had done.&nbsp; They were heavily taxed; they were 
disgracefully badged; they were, on one day, thirteen years after
the coronation, taken up with their wives and children and thrown
into beastly prisons, until they purchased their release by 
paying to the King twelve thousand pounds.&nbsp; Finally, every 
kind of property belonging to them was seized by the King, except
so little as would defray the charge of their taking themselves 
away into foreign countries.&nbsp; Many years elapsed before the 
hope of gain induced any of their race to return to England, 
where they had been treated so heartlessly and had suffered so 
much.</p>
<p>If King Edward the First had been as bad a king to Christians 
as he was to Jews, he would have been bad indeed.&nbsp; But he 
was, in general, a wise and great monarch, under whom the country
much improved.&nbsp; He had no love for the Great 
Charter&mdash;few Kings had, through many, many years&mdash;but 
he had high qualities.&nbsp; The first bold object which he 
conceived when he came home, was, to unite under one Sovereign 
England, Scotland, and Wales; the two last of which countries had
each a little king of its own, about whom the people were always 
quarrelling and fighting, and making a prodigious 
disturbance&mdash;a great deal more than he was worth.&nbsp; In 
the course of King Edward&rsquo;s reign he was engaged, besides, 
in a war with France.&nbsp; To make these quarrels clearer, we 
will separate their histories and take them thus.&nbsp; Wales, 
first.&nbsp; France, second.&nbsp; Scotland, third.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Llewellyn</span> was the Prince of 
Wales.&nbsp; He had been on the side of the Barons in the reign 
of the stupid old King, but had afterwards sworn allegiance to 
him.&nbsp; When King Edward came to the throne, Llewellyn was 
required to swear allegiance to him also; which he refused to 
do.&nbsp; The King, being crowned and in his own dominions, three
times more required Llewellyn to come and do homage; and three 
times more Llewellyn said he would rather not.&nbsp; He was going
to be married to <span class="smcap">Eleanor de Montfort</span>, 
a young lady of the family mentioned in the last reign; and it 
chanced that this young lady, coming from France with her 
youngest brother, <span class="smcap">Emeric</span>, was taken by
an English ship, and was ordered by the English King to be 
detained.&nbsp; Upon this, the quarrel came to a head.&nbsp; The 
King went, with his fleet, to the coast of Wales, where, so 
encompassing Llewellyn, that he could only take refuge in the 
bleak mountain region of Snowdon in which no provisions could 
reach him, he was soon starved into an apology, and into a treaty
of peace, and into paying the expenses of the war.&nbsp; The 
King, however, forgave him some of the hardest conditions of the 
treaty, and consented to his marriage.&nbsp; And he now thought 
he had reduced Wales to obedience.</p>
<p>But the Welsh, although they were naturally a gentle, quiet, 
pleasant people, who liked to receive strangers in their cottages
among the mountains, and to set before them with free hospitality
whatever they had to eat and drink, and to play to them on their 
harps, and sing their native ballads to them, were a people of 
great spirit when their blood was up.&nbsp; Englishmen, after 
this affair, began to be insolent in Wales, and to assume the air
of masters; and the Welsh pride could not bear it.&nbsp; 
Moreover, they believed in that unlucky old Merlin, some of whose
unlucky old prophecies somebody always seemed doomed to remember 
when there was a chance of its doing harm; and just at this time 
some blind old gentleman with a harp and a long white beard, who 
was an excellent person, but had become of an unknown age and 
tedious, burst out with a declaration that Merlin had predicted 
that when English money had become round, a Prince of Wales would
be crowned in London.&nbsp; Now, King Edward had recently 
forbidden the English penny to be cut into halves and quarters 
for halfpence and farthings, and had actually introduced a round 
coin; therefore, the Welsh people said this was the time Merlin 
meant, and rose accordingly.</p>
<p>King Edward had bought over <span class="smcap">Prince 
David</span>, Llewellyn&rsquo;s brother, by heaping favours upon 
him; but he was the first to revolt, being perhaps troubled in 
his conscience.&nbsp; One stormy night, he surprised the Castle 
of Hawarden, in possession of which an English nobleman had been 
left; killed the whole garrison, and carried off the nobleman a 
prisoner to Snowdon.&nbsp; Upon this, the Welsh people rose like 
one man.&nbsp; King Edward, with his army, marching from 
Worcester to the Menai Strait, crossed it&mdash;near to where the
wonderful tubular iron bridge now, in days so different, makes a 
passage for railway trains&mdash;by a bridge of boats that 
enabled forty men to march abreast.&nbsp; He subdued the Island 
of Anglesea, and sent his men forward to observe the enemy.&nbsp;
The sudden appearance of the Welsh created a panic among them, 
and they fell back to the bridge.&nbsp; The tide had in the 
meantime risen and separated the boats; the Welsh pursuing them, 
they were driven into the sea, and there they sunk, in their 
heavy iron armour, by thousands.&nbsp; After this victory 
Llewellyn, helped by the severe winter-weather of Wales, gained 
another battle; but the King ordering a portion of his English 
army to advance through South Wales, and catch him between two 
foes, and Llewellyn bravely turning to meet this new enemy, he 
was surprised and killed&mdash;very meanly, for he was unarmed 
and defenceless.&nbsp; His head was struck off and sent to 
London, where it was fixed upon the Tower, encircled with a 
wreath, some say of ivy, some say of willow, some say of silver, 
to make it look like a ghastly coin in ridicule of the 
prediction.</p>
<p>David, however, still held out for six months, though eagerly 
sought after by the King, and hunted by his own countrymen.&nbsp;
One of them finally betrayed him with his wife and 
children.&nbsp; He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and 
quartered; and from that time this became the established 
punishment of Traitors in England&mdash;a punishment wholly 
without excuse, as being revolting, vile, and cruel, after its 
object is dead; and which has no sense in it, as its only real 
degradation (and that nothing can blot out) is to the country 
that permits on any consideration such abominable barbarity.</p>
<p>Wales was now subdued.&nbsp; The Queen giving birth to a young
prince in the Castle of Carnarvon, the King showed him to the 
Welsh people as their countryman, and called him Prince of Wales;
a title that has ever since been borne by the heir-apparent to 
the English throne&mdash;which that little Prince soon became, by
the death of his elder brother.&nbsp; The King did better things 
for the Welsh than that, by improving their laws and encouraging 
their trade.&nbsp; Disturbances still took place, chiefly 
occasioned by the avarice and pride of the English Lords, on whom
Welsh lands and castles had been bestowed; but they were subdued,
and the country never rose again.&nbsp; There is a legend that to
prevent the people from being incited to rebellion by the songs 
of their bards and harpers, Edward had them all put to 
death.&nbsp; Some of them may have fallen among other men who 
held out against the King; but this general slaughter is, I 
think, a fancy of the harpers themselves, who, I dare say, made a
song about it many years afterwards, and sang it by the Welsh 
firesides until it came to be believed.</p>
<p>The foreign war of the reign of Edward the First arose in this
way.&nbsp; The crews of two vessels, one a Norman ship, and the 
other an English ship, happened to go to the same place in their 
boats to fill their casks with fresh water.&nbsp; Being rough 
angry fellows, they began to quarrel, and then to fight&mdash;the
English with their fists; the Normans with their 
knives&mdash;and, in the fight, a Norman was killed.&nbsp; The 
Norman crew, instead of revenging themselves upon those English 
sailors with whom they had quarrelled (who were too strong for 
them, I suspect), took to their ship again in a great rage, 
attacked the first English ship they met, laid hold of an 
unoffending merchant who happened to be on board, and brutally 
hanged him in the rigging of their own vessel with a dog at his 
feet.&nbsp; This so enraged the English sailors that there was no
restraining them; and whenever, and wherever, English sailors met
Norman sailors, they fell upon each other tooth and nail.&nbsp; 
The Irish and Dutch sailors took part with the English; the 
French and Genoese sailors helped the Normans; and thus the 
greater part of the mariners sailing over the sea became, in 
their way, as violent and raging as the sea itself when it is 
disturbed.</p>
<p>King Edward&rsquo;s fame had been so high abroad that he had 
been chosen to decide a difference between France and another 
foreign power, and had lived upon the Continent three 
years.&nbsp; At first, neither he nor the French King <span 
class="smcap">Philip</span> (the good Louis had been dead some 
time) interfered in these quarrels; but when a fleet of eighty 
English ships engaged and utterly defeated a Norman fleet of two 
hundred, in a pitched battle fought round a ship at anchor, in 
which no quarter was given, the matter became too serious to be 
passed over.&nbsp; King Edward, as Duke of Guienne, was summoned 
to present himself before the King of France, at Paris, and 
answer for the damage done by his sailor subjects.&nbsp; At 
first, he sent the Bishop of London as his representative, and 
then his brother <span class="smcap">Edmund</span>, who was 
married to the French Queen&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; I am afraid 
Edmund was an easy man, and allowed himself to be talked over by 
his charming relations, the French court ladies; at all events, 
he was induced to give up his brother&rsquo;s dukedom for forty 
days&mdash;as a mere form, the French King said, to satisfy his 
honour&mdash;and he was so very much astonished, when the time 
was out, to find that the French King had no idea of giving it up
again, that I should not wonder if it hastened his death: which 
soon took place.</p>
<p>King Edward was a King to win his foreign dukedom back again, 
if it could be won by energy and valour.&nbsp; He raised a large 
army, renounced his allegiance as Duke of Guienne, and crossed 
the sea to carry war into France.&nbsp; Before any important 
battle was fought, however, a truce was agreed upon for two 
years; and in the course of that time, the Pope effected a 
reconciliation.&nbsp; King Edward, who was now a widower, having 
lost his affectionate and good wife, Eleanor, married the French 
King&rsquo;s sister, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>; and the
Prince of Wales was contracted to the French King&rsquo;s 
daughter <span class="smcap">Isabella</span>.</p>
<p>Out of bad things, good things sometimes arise.&nbsp; Out of 
this hanging of the innocent merchant, and the bloodshed and 
strife it caused, there came to be established one of the 
greatest powers that the English people now possess.&nbsp; The 
preparations for the war being very expensive, and King Edward 
greatly wanting money, and being very arbitrary in his ways of 
raising it, some of the Barons began firmly to oppose him.&nbsp; 
Two of them, in particular, <span class="smcap">Humphrey 
Bohun</span>, Earl of Hereford, and <span class="smcap">Roger 
Bigod</span>, Earl of Norfolk, were so stout against him, that 
they maintained he had no right to command them to head his 
forces in Guienne, and flatly refused to go there.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;By Heaven, Sir Earl,&rsquo; said the King to the Earl of 
Hereford, in a great passion, &lsquo;you shall either go or be 
hanged!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;By Heaven, Sir King,&rsquo; replied 
the Earl, &lsquo;I will neither go nor yet will I be 
hanged!&rsquo; and both he and the other Earl sturdily left the 
court, attended by many Lords.&nbsp; The King tried every means 
of raising money.&nbsp; He taxed the clergy, in spite of all the 
Pope said to the contrary; and when they refused to pay, reduced 
them to submission, by saying Very well, then they had no claim 
upon the government for protection, and any man might plunder 
them who would&mdash;which a good many men were very ready to do,
and very readily did, and which the clergy found too losing a 
game to be played at long.&nbsp; He seized all the wool and 
leather in the hands of the merchants, promising to pay for it 
some fine day; and he set a tax upon the exportation of wool, 
which was so unpopular among the traders that it was called 
&lsquo;The evil toll.&rsquo;&nbsp; But all would not do.&nbsp; 
The Barons, led by those two great Earls, declared any taxes 
imposed without the consent of Parliament, unlawful; and the 
Parliament refused to impose taxes, until the King should confirm
afresh the two Great Charters, and should solemnly declare in 
writing, that there was no power in the country to raise money 
from the people, evermore, but the power of Parliament 
representing all ranks of the people.&nbsp; The King was very 
unwilling to diminish his own power by allowing this great 
privilege in the Parliament; but there was no help for it, and he
at last complied.&nbsp; We shall come to another King by-and-by, 
who might have saved his head from rolling off, if he had 
profited by this example.</p>
<p>The people gained other benefits in Parliament from the good 
sense and wisdom of this King.&nbsp; Many of the laws were much 
improved; provision was made for the greater safety of 
travellers, and the apprehension of thieves and murderers; the 
priests were prevented from holding too much land, and so 
becoming too powerful; and Justices of the Peace were first 
appointed (though not at first under that name) in various parts 
of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And now we come to Scotland, which was the great and lasting 
trouble of the reign of King Edward the First.</p>
<p>About thirteen years after King Edward&rsquo;s coronation, 
Alexander the Third, the King of Scotland, died of a fall from 
his horse.&nbsp; He had been married to Margaret, King 
Edward&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; All their children being dead, the 
Scottish crown became the right of a young Princess only eight 
years old, the daughter of <span class="smcap">Eric</span>, King 
of Norway, who had married a daughter of the deceased 
sovereign.&nbsp; King Edward proposed, that the Maiden of Norway,
as this Princess was called, should be engaged to be married to 
his eldest son; but, unfortunately, as she was coming over to 
England she fell sick, and landing on one of the Orkney Islands, 
died there.&nbsp; A great commotion immediately began in 
Scotland, where as many as thirteen noisy claimants to the vacant
throne started up and made a general confusion.</p>
<p>King Edward being much renowned for his sagacity and justice, 
it seems to have been agreed to refer the dispute to him.&nbsp; 
He accepted the trust, and went, with an army, to the Border-land
where England and Scotland joined.&nbsp; There, he called upon 
the Scottish gentlemen to meet him at the Castle of Norham, on 
the English side of the river Tweed; and to that Castle they 
came.&nbsp; But, before he would take any step in the business, 
he required those Scottish gentlemen, one and all, to do homage 
to him as their superior Lord; and when they hesitated, he said, 
&lsquo;By holy Edward, whose crown I wear, I will have my rights,
or I will die in maintaining them!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Scottish 
gentlemen, who had not expected this, were disconcerted, and 
asked for three weeks to think about it.</p>
<p>At the end of the three weeks, another meeting took place, on 
a green plain on the Scottish side of the river.&nbsp; Of all the
competitors for the Scottish throne, there were only two who had 
any real claim, in right of their near kindred to the Royal 
Family.&nbsp; These were <span class="smcap">John Baliol</span> 
and <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>: and the right was, I
have no doubt, on the side of John Baliol.&nbsp; At this 
particular meeting John Baliol was not present, but Robert Bruce 
was; and on Robert Bruce being formally asked whether he 
acknowledged the King of England for his superior lord, he 
answered, plainly and distinctly, Yes, he did.&nbsp; Next day, 
John Baliol appeared, and said the same.&nbsp; This point 
settled, some arrangements were made for inquiring into their 
titles.</p>
<p>The inquiry occupied a pretty long time&mdash;more than a 
year.&nbsp; While it was going on, King Edward took the 
opportunity of making a journey through Scotland, and calling 
upon the Scottish people of all degrees to acknowledge themselves
his vassals, or be imprisoned until they did.&nbsp; In the 
meanwhile, Commissioners were appointed to conduct the inquiry, a
Parliament was held at Berwick about it, the two claimants were 
heard at full length, and there was a vast amount of 
talking.&nbsp; At last, in the great hall of the Castle of 
Berwick, the King gave judgment in favour of John Baliol: who, 
consenting to receive his crown by the King of England&rsquo;s 
favour and permission, was crowned at Scone, in an old stone 
chair which had been used for ages in the abbey there, at the 
coronations of Scottish Kings.&nbsp; Then, King Edward caused the
great seal of Scotland, used since the late King&rsquo;s death, 
to be broken in four pieces, and placed in the English Treasury; 
and considered that he now had Scotland (according to the common 
saying) under his thumb.</p>
<p>Scotland had a strong will of its own yet, however.&nbsp; King
Edward, determined that the Scottish King should not forget he 
was his vassal, summoned him repeatedly to come and defend 
himself and his judges before the English Parliament when appeals
from the decisions of Scottish courts of justice were being 
heard.&nbsp; At length, John Baliol, who had no great heart of 
his own, had so much heart put into him by the brave spirit of 
the Scottish people, who took this as a national insult, that he 
refused to come any more.&nbsp; Thereupon, the King further 
required him to help him in his war abroad (which was then in 
progress), and to give up, as security for his good behaviour in 
future, the three strong Scottish Castles of Jedburgh, Roxburgh, 
and Berwick.&nbsp; Nothing of this being done; on the contrary, 
the Scottish people concealing their King among their mountains 
in the Highlands and showing a determination to resist; Edward 
marched to Berwick with an army of thirty thousand foot, and four
thousand horse; took the Castle, and slew its whole garrison, and
the inhabitants of the town as well&mdash;men, women, and 
children.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lord Warrenne</span>, Earl of
Surrey, then went on to the Castle of Dunbar, before which a 
battle was fought, and the whole Scottish army defeated with 
great slaughter.&nbsp; The victory being complete, the Earl of 
Surrey was left as guardian of Scotland; the principal offices in
that kingdom were given to Englishmen; the more powerful Scottish
Nobles were obliged to come and live in England; the Scottish 
crown and sceptre were brought away; and even the old stone chair
was carried off and placed in Westminster Abbey, where you may 
see it now.&nbsp; Baliol had the Tower of London lent him for a 
residence, with permission to range about within a circle of 
twenty miles.&nbsp; Three years afterwards he was allowed to go 
to Normandy, where he had estates, and where he passed the 
remaining six years of his life: far more happily, I dare say, 
than he had lived for a long while in angry Scotland.</p>
<p>Now, there was, in the West of Scotland, a gentleman of small 
fortune, named <span class="smcap">William Wallace</span>, the 
second son of a Scottish knight.&nbsp; He was a man of great size
and great strength; he was very brave and daring; when he spoke 
to a body of his countrymen, he could rouse them in a wonderful 
manner by the power of his burning words; he loved Scotland 
dearly, and he hated England with his utmost might.&nbsp; The 
domineering conduct of the English who now held the places of 
trust in Scotland made them as intolerable to the proud Scottish 
people as they had been, under similar circumstances, to the 
Welsh; and no man in all Scotland regarded them with so much 
smothered rage as William Wallace.&nbsp; One day, an Englishman 
in office, little knowing what he was, affronted 
<i>him</i>.&nbsp; Wallace instantly struck him dead, and taking 
refuge among the rocks and hills, and there joining with his 
countryman, <span class="smcap">Sir William Douglas</span>, who 
was also in arms against King Edward, became the most resolute 
and undaunted champion of a people struggling for their 
independence that ever lived upon the earth.</p>
<p>The English Guardian of the Kingdom fled before him, and, thus
encouraged, the Scottish people revolted everywhere, and fell 
upon the English without mercy.&nbsp; The Earl of Surrey, by the 
King&rsquo;s commands, raised all the power of the 
Border-counties, and two English armies poured into 
Scotland.&nbsp; Only one Chief, in the face of those armies, 
stood by Wallace, who, with a force of forty thousand men, 
awaited the invaders at a place on the river Forth, within two 
miles of Stirling.&nbsp; Across the river there was only one poor
wooden bridge, called the bridge of Kildean&mdash;so narrow, that
but two men could cross it abreast.&nbsp; With his eyes upon this
bridge, Wallace posted the greater part of his men among some 
rising grounds, and waited calmly.&nbsp; When the English army 
came up on the opposite bank of the river, messengers were sent 
forward to offer terms.&nbsp; Wallace sent them back with a 
defiance, in the name of the freedom of Scotland.&nbsp; Some of 
the officers of the Earl of Surrey in command of the English, 
with <i>their</i> eyes also on the bridge, advised him to be 
discreet and not hasty.&nbsp; He, however, urged to immediate 
battle by some other officers, and particularly by <span 
class="smcap">Cressingham</span>, King Edward&rsquo;s treasurer, 
and a rash man, gave the word of command to advance.&nbsp; One 
thousand English crossed the bridge, two abreast; the Scottish 
troops were as motionless as stone images.&nbsp; Two thousand 
English crossed; three thousand, four thousand, five.&nbsp; Not a
feather, all this time, had been seen to stir among the Scottish 
bonnets.&nbsp; Now, they all fluttered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Forward, one
party, to the foot of the Bridge!&rsquo; cried Wallace, 
&lsquo;and let no more English cross!&nbsp; The rest, down with 
me on the five thousand who have come over, and cut them all to 
pieces!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was done, in the sight of the whole 
remainder of the English army, who could give no help.&nbsp; 
Cressingham himself was killed, and the Scotch made whips for 
their horses of his skin.</p>
<p>King Edward was abroad at this time, and during the successes 
on the Scottish side which followed, and which enabled bold 
Wallace to win the whole country back again, and even to ravage 
the English borders.&nbsp; But, after a few winter months, the 
King returned, and took the field with more than his usual 
energy.&nbsp; One night, when a kick from his horse as they both 
lay on the ground together broke two of his ribs, and a cry arose
that he was killed, he leaped into his saddle, regardless of the 
pain he suffered, and rode through the camp.&nbsp; Day then 
appearing, he gave the word (still, of course, in that bruised 
and aching state) Forward! and led his army on to near Falkirk, 
where the Scottish forces were seen drawn up on some stony 
ground, behind a morass.&nbsp; Here, he defeated Wallace, and 
killed fifteen thousand of his men.&nbsp; With the shattered 
remainder, Wallace drew back to Stirling; but, being pursued, set
fire to the town that it might give no help to the English, and 
escaped.&nbsp; The inhabitants of Perth afterwards set fire to 
their houses for the same reason, and the King, unable to find 
provisions, was forced to withdraw his army.</p>
<p>Another <span class="smcap">Robert Bruce</span>, the grandson 
of him who had disputed the Scottish crown with Baliol, was now 
in arms against the King (that elder Bruce being dead), and also 
<span class="smcap">John Comyn</span>, Baliol&rsquo;s 
nephew.&nbsp; These two young men might agree in opposing Edward,
but could agree in nothing else, as they were rivals for the 
throne of Scotland.&nbsp; Probably it was because they knew this,
and knew what troubles must arise even if they could hope to get 
the better of the great English King, that the principal Scottish
people applied to the Pope for his interference.&nbsp; The Pope, 
on the principle of losing nothing for want of trying to get it, 
very coolly claimed that Scotland belonged to him; but this was a
little too much, and the Parliament in a friendly manner told him
so.</p>
<p>In the spring time of the year one thousand three hundred and 
three, the King sent <span class="smcap">Sir John Segrave</span>,
whom he made Governor of Scotland, with twenty thousand men, to 
reduce the rebels.&nbsp; Sir John was not as careful as he should
have been, but encamped at Rosslyn, near Edinburgh, with his army
divided into three parts.&nbsp; The Scottish forces saw their 
advantage; fell on each part separately; defeated each; and 
killed all the prisoners.&nbsp; Then, came the King himself once 
more, as soon as a great army could be raised; he passed through 
the whole north of Scotland, laying waste whatsoever came in his 
way; and he took up his winter quarters at Dunfermline.&nbsp; The
Scottish cause now looked so hopeless, that Comyn and the other 
nobles made submission and received their pardons.&nbsp; Wallace 
alone stood out.&nbsp; He was invited to surrender, though on no 
distinct pledge that his life should be spared; but he still 
defied the ireful King, and lived among the steep crags of the 
Highland glens, where the eagles made their nests, and where the 
mountain torrents roared, and the white snow was deep, and the 
bitter winds blew round his unsheltered head, as he lay through 
many a pitch-dark night wrapped up in his plaid.&nbsp; Nothing 
could break his spirit; nothing could lower his courage; nothing 
could induce him to forget or to forgive his country&rsquo;s 
wrongs.&nbsp; Even when the Castle of Stirling, which had long 
held out, was besieged by the King with every kind of military 
engine then in use; even when the lead upon cathedral roofs was 
taken down to help to make them; even when the King, though an 
old man, commanded in the siege as if he were a youth, being so 
resolved to conquer; even when the brave garrison (then found 
with amazement to be not two hundred people, including several 
ladies) were starved and beaten out and were made to submit on 
their knees, and with every form of disgrace that could aggravate
their sufferings; even then, when there was not a ray of hope in 
Scotland, William Wallace was as proud and firm as if he had 
beheld the powerful and relentless Edward lying dead at his 
feet.</p>
<p>Who betrayed William Wallace in the end, is not quite 
certain.&nbsp; That he was betrayed&mdash;probably by an 
attendant&mdash;is too true.&nbsp; He was taken to the Castle of 
Dumbarton, under <span class="smcap">Sir John Menteith</span>, 
and thence to London, where the great fame of his bravery and 
resolution attracted immense concourses of people to behold 
him.&nbsp; He was tried in Westminster Hall, with a crown of 
laurel on his head&mdash;it is supposed because he was reported 
to have said that he ought to wear, or that he would wear, a 
crown there and was found guilty as a robber, a murderer, and a 
traitor.&nbsp; What they called a robber (he said to those who 
tried him) he was, because he had taken spoil from the 
King&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; What they called a murderer, he was, 
because he had slain an insolent Englishman.&nbsp; What they 
called a traitor, he was not, for he had never sworn allegiance 
to the King, and had ever scorned to do it.&nbsp; He was dragged 
at the tails of horses to West Smithfield, and there hanged on a 
high gallows, torn open before he was dead, beheaded, and 
quartered.&nbsp; His head was set upon a pole on London Bridge, 
his right arm was sent to Newcastle, his left arm to Berwick, his
legs to Perth and Aberdeen.&nbsp; But, if King Edward had had his
body cut into inches, and had sent every separate inch into a 
separate town, he could not have dispersed it half so far and 
wide as his fame.&nbsp; Wallace will be remembered in songs and 
stories, while there are songs and stories in the English tongue,
and Scotland will hold him dear while her lakes and mountains 
last.</p>
<p>Released from this dreaded enemy, the King made a fairer plan 
of Government for Scotland, divided the offices of honour among 
Scottish gentlemen and English gentlemen, forgave past offences, 
and thought, in his old age, that his work was done.</p>
<p>But he deceived himself.&nbsp; Comyn and Bruce conspired, and 
made an appointment to meet at Dumfries, in the church of the 
Minorites.&nbsp; There is a story that Comyn was false to Bruce, 
and had informed against him to the King; that Bruce was warned 
of his danger and the necessity of flight, by receiving, one 
night as he sat at supper, from his friend the Earl of 
Gloucester, twelve pennies and a pair of spurs; that as he was 
riding angrily to keep his appointment (through a snow-storm, 
with his horse&rsquo;s shoes reversed that he might not be 
tracked), he met an evil-looking serving man, a messenger of 
Comyn, whom he killed, and concealed in whose dress he found 
letters that proved Comyn&rsquo;s treachery.&nbsp; However this 
may be, they were likely enough to quarrel in any case, being 
hot-headed rivals; and, whatever they quarrelled about, they 
certainly did quarrel in the church where they met, and Bruce 
drew his dagger and stabbed Comyn, who fell upon the 
pavement.&nbsp; When Bruce came out, pale and disturbed, the 
friends who were waiting for him asked what was the matter?&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think I have killed Comyn,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You only think so?&rsquo; returned one of them; &lsquo;I 
will make sure!&rsquo; and going into the church, and finding him
alive, stabbed him again and again.&nbsp; Knowing that the King 
would never forgive this new deed of violence, the party then 
declared Bruce King of Scotland: got him crowned at 
Scone&mdash;without the chair; and set up the rebellious standard
once again.</p>
<p>When the King heard of it he kindled with fiercer anger than 
he had ever shown yet.&nbsp; He caused the Prince of Wales and 
two hundred and seventy of the young nobility to be 
knighted&mdash;the trees in the Temple Gardens were cut down to 
make room for their tents, and they watched their armour all 
night, according to the old usage: some in the Temple Church: 
some in Westminster Abbey&mdash;and at the public Feast which 
then took place, he swore, by Heaven, and by two swans covered 
with gold network which his minstrels placed upon the table, that
he would avenge the death of Comyn, and would punish the false 
Bruce.&nbsp; And before all the company, he charged the Prince 
his son, in case that he should die before accomplishing his vow,
not to bury him until it was fulfilled.&nbsp; Next morning the 
Prince and the rest of the young Knights rode away to the 
Border-country to join the English army; and the King, now weak 
and sick, followed in a horse-litter.</p>
<p>Bruce, after losing a battle and undergoing many dangers and 
much misery, fled to Ireland, where he lay concealed through the 
winter.&nbsp; That winter, Edward passed in hunting down and 
executing Bruce&rsquo;s relations and adherents, sparing neither 
youth nor age, and showing no touch of pity or sign of 
mercy.&nbsp; In the following spring, Bruce reappeared and gained
some victories.&nbsp; In these frays, both sides were grievously 
cruel.&nbsp; For instance&mdash;Bruce&rsquo;s two brothers, being
taken captives desperately wounded, were ordered by the King to 
instant execution.&nbsp; Bruce&rsquo;s friend Sir John Douglas, 
taking his own Castle of Douglas out of the hands of an English 
Lord, roasted the dead bodies of the slaughtered garrison in a 
great fire made of every movable within it; which dreadful 
cookery his men called the Douglas Larder.&nbsp; Bruce, still 
successful, however, drove the Earl of Pembroke and the Earl of 
Gloucester into the Castle of Ayr and laid siege to it.</p>
<p>The King, who had been laid up all the winter, but had 
directed the army from his sick-bed, now advanced to Carlisle, 
and there, causing the litter in which he had travelled to be 
placed in the Cathedral as an offering to Heaven, mounted his 
horse once more, and for the last time.&nbsp; He was now 
sixty-nine years old, and had reigned thirty-five years.&nbsp; He
was so ill, that in four days he could go no more than six miles;
still, even at that pace, he went on and resolutely kept his face
towards the Border.&nbsp; At length, he lay down at the village 
of Burgh-upon-Sands; and there, telling those around him to 
impress upon the Prince that he was to remember his 
father&rsquo;s vow, and was never to rest until he had thoroughly
subdued Scotland, he yielded up his last breath.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SECOND</h2>
<p>King Edward the Second, the first Prince of Wales, was 
twenty-three years old when his father died.&nbsp; There was a 
certain favourite of his, a young man from Gascony, named <span 
class="smcap">Piers Gaveston</span>, of whom his father had so 
much disapproved that he had ordered him out of England, and had 
made his son swear by the side of his sick-bed, never to bring 
him back.&nbsp; But, the Prince no sooner found himself King, 
than he broke his oath, as so many other Princes and Kings did 
(they were far too ready to take oaths), and sent for his dear 
friend immediately.</p>
<p>Now, this same Gaveston was handsome enough, but was a 
reckless, insolent, audacious fellow.&nbsp; He was detested by 
the proud English Lords: not only because he had such power over 
the King, and made the Court such a dissipated place, but, also, 
because he could ride better than they at tournaments, and was 
used, in his impudence, to cut very bad jokes on them; calling 
one, the old hog; another, the stage-player; another, the Jew; 
another, the black dog of Ardenne.&nbsp; This was as poor wit as 
need be, but it made those Lords very wroth; and the surly Earl 
of Warwick, who was the black dog, swore that the time should 
come when Piers Gaveston should feel the black dog&rsquo;s 
teeth.</p>
<p>It was not come yet, however, nor did it seem to be 
coming.&nbsp; The King made him Earl of Cornwall, and gave him 
vast riches; and, when the King went over to France to marry the 
French Princess, <span class="smcap">Isabella</span>, daughter of
<span class="smcap">Philip le Bel</span>: who was said to be the 
most beautiful woman in the world: he made Gaveston, Regent of 
the Kingdom.&nbsp; His splendid marriage-ceremony in the Church 
of Our Lady at Boulogne, where there were four Kings and three 
Queens present (quite a pack of Court Cards, for I dare say the 
Knaves were not wanting), being over, he seemed to care little or
nothing for his beautiful wife; but was wild with impatience to 
meet Gaveston again.</p>
<p>When he landed at home, he paid no attention to anybody else, 
but ran into the favourite&rsquo;s arms before a great concourse 
of people, and hugged him, and kissed him, and called him his 
brother.&nbsp; At the coronation which soon followed, Gaveston 
was the richest and brightest of all the glittering company 
there, and had the honour of carrying the crown.&nbsp; This made 
the proud Lords fiercer than ever; the people, too, despised the 
favourite, and would never call him Earl of Cornwall, however 
much he complained to the King and asked him to punish them for 
not doing so, but persisted in styling him plain Piers 
Gaveston.</p>
<p>The Barons were so unceremonious with the King in giving him 
to understand that they would not bear this favourite, that the 
King was obliged to send him out of the country.&nbsp; The 
favourite himself was made to take an oath (more oaths!) that he 
would never come back, and the Barons supposed him to be banished
in disgrace, until they heard that he was appointed Governor of 
Ireland.&nbsp; Even this was not enough for the besotted King, 
who brought him home again in a year&rsquo;s time, and not only 
disgusted the Court and the people by his doting folly, but 
offended his beautiful wife too, who never liked him 
afterwards.</p>
<p>He had now the old Royal want&mdash;of money&mdash;and the 
Barons had the new power of positively refusing to let him raise 
any.&nbsp; He summoned a Parliament at York; the Barons refused 
to make one, while the favourite was near him.&nbsp; He summoned 
another Parliament at Westminster, and sent Gaveston away.&nbsp; 
Then, the Barons came, completely armed, and appointed a 
committee of themselves to correct abuses in the state and in the
King&rsquo;s household.&nbsp; He got some money on these 
conditions, and directly set off with Gaveston to the 
Border-country, where they spent it in idling away the time, and 
feasting, while Bruce made ready to drive the English out of 
Scotland.&nbsp; For, though the old King had even made this poor 
weak son of his swear (as some say) that he would not bury his 
bones, but would have them boiled clean in a caldron, and carried
before the English army until Scotland was entirely subdued, the 
second Edward was so unlike the first that Bruce gained strength 
and power every day.</p>
<p>The committee of Nobles, after some months of deliberation, 
ordained that the King should henceforth call a Parliament 
together, once every year, and even twice if necessary, instead 
of summoning it only when he chose.&nbsp; Further, that Gaveston 
should once more be banished, and, this time, on pain of death if
he ever came back.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s tears were of no avail;
he was obliged to send his favourite to Flanders.&nbsp; As soon 
as he had done so, however, he dissolved the Parliament, with the
low cunning of a mere fool, and set off to the North of England, 
thinking to get an army about him to oppose the Nobles.&nbsp; And
once again he brought Gaveston home, and heaped upon him all the 
riches and titles of which the Barons had deprived him.</p>
<p>The Lords saw, now, that there was nothing for it but to put 
the favourite to death.&nbsp; They could have done so, legally, 
according to the terms of his banishment; but they did so, I am 
sorry to say, in a shabby manner.&nbsp; Led by the Earl of 
Lancaster, the King&rsquo;s cousin, they first of all attacked 
the King and Gaveston at Newcastle.&nbsp; They had time to escape
by sea, and the mean King, having his precious Gaveston with him,
was quite content to leave his lovely wife behind.&nbsp; When 
they were comparatively safe, they separated; the King went to 
York to collect a force of soldiers; and the favourite shut 
himself up, in the meantime, in Scarborough Castle overlooking 
the sea.&nbsp; This was what the Barons wanted.&nbsp; They knew 
that the Castle could not hold out; they attacked it, and made 
Gaveston surrender.&nbsp; He delivered himself up to the Earl of 
Pembroke&mdash;that Lord whom he had called the Jew&mdash;on the 
Earl&rsquo;s pledging his faith and knightly word, that no harm 
should happen to him and no violence be done him.</p>
<p>Now, it was agreed with Gaveston that he should be taken to 
the Castle of Wallingford, and there kept in honourable 
custody.&nbsp; They travelled as far as Dedington, near Banbury, 
where, in the Castle of that place, they stopped for a night to 
rest.&nbsp; Whether the Earl of Pembroke left his prisoner there,
knowing what would happen, or really left him thinking no harm, 
and only going (as he pretended) to visit his wife, the Countess,
who was in the neighbourhood, is no great matter now; in any 
case, he was bound as an honourable gentleman to protect his 
prisoner, and he did not do it.&nbsp; In the morning, while the 
favourite was yet in bed, he was required to dress himself and 
come down into the court-yard.&nbsp; He did so without any 
mistrust, but started and turned pale when he found it full of 
strange armed men.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think you know me?&rsquo; said 
their leader, also armed from head to foot.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am the
black dog of Ardenne!&rsquo;&nbsp; The time was come when Piers 
Gaveston was to feel the black dog&rsquo;s teeth indeed.&nbsp; 
They set him on a mule, and carried him, in mock state and with 
military music, to the black dog&rsquo;s kennel&mdash;Warwick 
Castle&mdash;where a hasty council, composed of some great 
noblemen, considered what should be done with him.&nbsp; Some 
were for sparing him, but one loud voice&mdash;it was the black 
dog&rsquo;s bark, I dare say&mdash;sounded through the Castle 
Hall, uttering these words: &lsquo;You have the fox in your 
power.&nbsp; Let him go now, and you must hunt him 
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They sentenced him to death.&nbsp; He threw himself at the 
feet of the Earl of Lancaster&mdash;the old hog&mdash;but the old
hog was as savage as the dog.&nbsp; He was taken out upon the 
pleasant road, leading from Warwick to Coventry, where the 
beautiful river Avon, by which, long afterwards, <span 
class="smcap">William Shakespeare</span> was born and now lies 
buried, sparkled in the bright landscape of the beautiful 
May-day; and there they struck off his wretched head, and stained
the dust with his blood.</p>
<p>When the King heard of this black deed, in his grief and rage 
he denounced relentless war against his Barons, and both sides 
were in arms for half a year.&nbsp; But, it then became necessary
for them to join their forces against Bruce, who had used the 
time well while they were divided, and had now a great power in 
Scotland.</p>
<p>Intelligence was brought that Bruce was then besieging 
Stirling Castle, and that the Governor had been obliged to pledge
himself to surrender it, unless he should be relieved before a 
certain day.&nbsp; Hereupon, the King ordered the nobles and 
their fighting-men to meet him at Berwick; but, the nobles cared 
so little for the King, and so neglected the summons, and lost 
time, that only on the day before that appointed for the 
surrender, did the King find himself at Stirling, and even then 
with a smaller force than he had expected.&nbsp; However, he had,
altogether, a hundred thousand men, and Bruce had not more than 
forty thousand; but, Bruce&rsquo;s army was strongly posted in 
three square columns, on the ground lying between the Burn or 
Brook of Bannock and the walls of Stirling Castle.</p>
<p>On the very evening, when the King came up, Bruce did a brave 
act that encouraged his men.&nbsp; He was seen by a certain <span
class="smcap">Henry de Bohun</span>, an English Knight, riding 
about before his army on a little horse, with a light battle-axe 
in his hand, and a crown of gold on his head.&nbsp; This English 
Knight, who was mounted on a strong war-horse, cased in steel, 
strongly armed, and able (as he thought) to overthrow Bruce by 
crushing him with his mere weight, set spurs to his great 
charger, rode on him, and made a thrust at him with his heavy 
spear.&nbsp; Bruce parried the thrust, and with one blow of his 
battle-axe split his skull.</p>
<p>The Scottish men did not forget this, next day when the battle
raged.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Randolph</span>, Bruce&rsquo;s 
valiant Nephew, rode, with the small body of men he commanded, 
into such a host of the English, all shining in polished armour 
in the sunlight, that they seemed to be swallowed up and lost, as
if they had plunged into the sea.&nbsp; But, they fought so well,
and did such dreadful execution, that the English 
staggered.&nbsp; Then came Bruce himself upon them, with all the 
rest of his army.&nbsp; While they were thus hard pressed and 
amazed, there appeared upon the hills what they supposed to be a 
new Scottish army, but what were really only the camp followers, 
in number fifteen thousand: whom Bruce had taught to show 
themselves at that place and time.&nbsp; The Earl of Gloucester, 
commanding the English horse, made a last rush to change the 
fortune of the day; but Bruce (like Jack the Giant-killer in the 
story) had had pits dug in the ground, and covered over with 
turfs and stakes.&nbsp; Into these, as they gave way beneath the 
weight of the horses, riders and horses rolled by hundreds.&nbsp;
The English were completely routed; all their treasure, stores, 
and engines, were taken by the Scottish men; so many waggons and 
other wheeled vehicles were seized, that it is related that they 
would have reached, if they had been drawn out in a line, one 
hundred and eighty miles.&nbsp; The fortunes of Scotland were, 
for the time, completely changed; and never was a battle won, 
more famous upon Scottish ground, than this great battle of <span
class="smcap">Bannockburn</span>.</p>
<p>Plague and famine succeeded in England; and still the 
powerless King and his disdainful Lords were always in 
contention.&nbsp; Some of the turbulent chiefs of Ireland made 
proposals to Bruce, to accept the rule of that country.&nbsp; He 
sent his brother Edward to them, who was crowned King of 
Ireland.&nbsp; He afterwards went himself to help his brother in 
his Irish wars, but his brother was defeated in the end and 
killed.&nbsp; Robert Bruce, returning to Scotland, still 
increased his strength there.</p>
<p>As the King&rsquo;s ruin had begun in a favourite, so it 
seemed likely to end in one.&nbsp; He was too poor a creature to 
rely at all upon himself; and his new favourite was one <span 
class="smcap">Hugh le Despenser</span>, the son of a gentleman of
ancient family.&nbsp; Hugh was handsome and brave, but he was the
favourite of a weak King, whom no man cared a rush for, and that 
was a dangerous place to hold.&nbsp; The Nobles leagued against 
him, because the King liked him; and they lay in wait, both for 
his ruin and his father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Now, the King had married 
him to the daughter of the late Earl of Gloucester, and had given
both him and his father great possessions in Wales.&nbsp; In 
their endeavours to extend these, they gave violent offence to an
angry Welsh gentleman, named <span class="smcap">John de 
Mowbray</span>, and to divers other angry Welsh gentlemen, who 
resorted to arms, took their castles, and seized their 
estates.&nbsp; The Earl of Lancaster had first placed the 
favourite (who was a poor relation of his own) at Court, and he 
considered his own dignity offended by the preference he received
and the honours he acquired; so he, and the Barons who were his 
friends, joined the Welshmen, marched on London, and sent a 
message to the King demanding to have the favourite and his 
father banished.&nbsp; At first, the King unaccountably took it 
into his head to be spirited, and to send them a bold reply; but 
when they quartered themselves around Holborn and Clerkenwell, 
and went down, armed, to the Parliament at Westminster, he gave 
way, and complied with their demands.</p>
<p>His turn of triumph came sooner than he expected.&nbsp; It 
arose out of an accidental circumstance.&nbsp; The beautiful 
Queen happening to be travelling, came one night to one of the 
royal castles, and demanded to be lodged and entertained there 
until morning.&nbsp; The governor of this castle, who was one of 
the enraged lords, was away, and in his absence, his wife refused
admission to the Queen; a scuffle took place among the common men
on either side, and some of the royal attendants were 
killed.&nbsp; The people, who cared nothing for the King, were 
very angry that their beautiful Queen should be thus rudely 
treated in her own dominions; and the King, taking advantage of 
this feeling, besieged the castle, took it, and then called the 
two Despensers home.&nbsp; Upon this, the confederate lords and 
the Welshmen went over to Bruce.&nbsp; The King encountered them 
at Boroughbridge, gained the victory, and took a number of 
distinguished prisoners; among them, the Earl of Lancaster, now 
an old man, upon whose destruction he was resolved.&nbsp; This 
Earl was taken to his own castle of Pontefract, and there tried 
and found guilty by an unfair court appointed for the purpose; he
was not even allowed to speak in his own defence.&nbsp; He was 
insulted, pelted, mounted on a starved pony without saddle or 
bridle, carried out, and beheaded.&nbsp; Eight-and-twenty knights
were hanged, drawn, and quartered.&nbsp; When the King had 
despatched this bloody work, and had made a fresh and a long 
truce with Bruce, he took the Despensers into greater favour than
ever, and made the father Earl of Winchester.</p>
<p>One prisoner, and an important one, who was taken at 
Boroughbridge, made his escape, however, and turned the tide 
against the King.&nbsp; This was <span class="smcap">Roger 
Mortimer</span>, always resolutely opposed to him, who was 
sentenced to death, and placed for safe custody in the Tower of 
London.&nbsp; He treated his guards to a quantity of wine into 
which he had put a sleeping potion; and, when they were 
insensible, broke out of his dungeon, got into a kitchen, climbed
up the chimney, let himself down from the roof of the building 
with a rope-ladder, passed the sentries, got down to the river, 
and made away in a boat to where servants and horses were waiting
for him.&nbsp; He finally escaped to France, where <span 
class="smcap">Charles le Bel</span>, the brother of the beautiful
Queen, was King.&nbsp; Charles sought to quarrel with the King of
England, on pretence of his not having come to do him homage at 
his coronation.&nbsp; It was proposed that the beautiful Queen 
should go over to arrange the dispute; she went, and wrote home 
to the King, that as he was sick and could not come to France 
himself, perhaps it would be better to send over the young 
Prince, their son, who was only twelve years old, who could do 
homage to her brother in his stead, and in whose company she 
would immediately return.&nbsp; The King sent him: but, both he 
and the Queen remained at the French Court, and Roger Mortimer 
became the Queen&rsquo;s lover.</p>
<p>When the King wrote, again and again, to the Queen to come 
home, she did not reply that she despised him too much to live 
with him any more (which was the truth), but said she was afraid 
of the two Despensers.&nbsp; In short, her design was to 
overthrow the favourites&rsquo; power, and the King&rsquo;s 
power, such as it was, and invade England.&nbsp; Having obtained 
a French force of two thousand men, and being joined by all the 
English exiles then in France, she landed, within a year, at 
Orewell, in Suffolk, where she was immediately joined by the 
Earls of Kent and Norfolk, the King&rsquo;s two brothers; by 
other powerful noblemen; and lastly, by the first English general
who was despatched to check her: who went over to her with all 
his men.&nbsp; The people of London, receiving these tidings, 
would do nothing for the King, but broke open the Tower, let out 
all his prisoners, and threw up their caps and hurrahed for the 
beautiful Queen.</p>
<p>The King, with his two favourites, fled to Bristol, where he 
left old Despenser in charge of the town and castle, while he 
went on with the son to Wales.&nbsp; The Bristol men being 
opposed to the King, and it being impossible to hold the town 
with enemies everywhere within the walls, Despenser yielded it up
on the third day, and was instantly brought to trial for having 
traitorously influenced what was called &lsquo;the King&rsquo;s 
mind&rsquo;&mdash;though I doubt if the King ever had any.&nbsp; 
He was a venerable old man, upwards of ninety years of age, but 
his age gained no respect or mercy.&nbsp; He was hanged, torn 
open while he was yet alive, cut up into pieces, and thrown to 
the dogs.&nbsp; His son was soon taken, tried at Hereford before 
the same judge on a long series of foolish charges, found guilty,
and hanged upon a gallows fifty feet high, with a chaplet of 
nettles round his head.&nbsp; His poor old father and he were 
innocent enough of any worse crimes than the crime of having been
friends of a King, on whom, as a mere man, they would never have 
deigned to cast a favourable look.&nbsp; It is a bad crime, I 
know, and leads to worse; but, many lords and gentlemen&mdash;I 
even think some ladies, too, if I recollect right&mdash;have 
committed it in England, who have neither been given to the dogs,
nor hanged up fifty feet high.</p>
<p>The wretched King was running here and there, all this time, 
and never getting anywhere in particular, until he gave himself 
up, and was taken off to Kenilworth Castle.&nbsp; When he was 
safely lodged there, the Queen went to London and met the 
Parliament.&nbsp; And the Bishop of Hereford, who was the most 
skilful of her friends, said, What was to be done now?&nbsp; Here
was an imbecile, indolent, miserable King upon the throne; 
wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to take him off, and put his son 
there instead?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether the Queen really 
pitied him at this pass, but she began to cry; so, the Bishop 
said, Well, my Lords and Gentlemen, what do you think, upon the 
whole, of sending down to Kenilworth, and seeing if His Majesty 
(God bless him, and forbid we should depose him!) won&rsquo;t 
resign?</p>
<p>My Lords and Gentlemen thought it a good notion, so a 
deputation of them went down to Kenilworth; and there the King 
came into the great hall of the Castle, commonly dressed in a 
poor black gown; and when he saw a certain bishop among them, 
fell down, poor feeble-headed man, and made a wretched spectacle 
of himself.&nbsp; Somebody lifted him up, and then <span 
class="smcap">Sir William Trussel</span>, the Speaker of the 
House of Commons, almost frightened him to death by making him a 
tremendous speech to the effect that he was no longer a King, and
that everybody renounced allegiance to him.&nbsp; After which, 
<span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Blount</span>, the Steward of the 
Household, nearly finished him, by coming forward and breaking 
his white wand&mdash;which was a ceremony only performed at a 
King&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Being asked in this pressing manner 
what he thought of resigning, the King said he thought it was the
best thing he could do.&nbsp; So, he did it, and they proclaimed 
his son next day.</p>
<p>I wish I could close his history by saying that he lived a 
harmless life in the Castle and the Castle gardens at Kenilworth,
many years&mdash;that he had a favourite, and plenty to eat and 
drink&mdash;and, having that, wanted nothing.&nbsp; But he was 
shamefully humiliated.&nbsp; He was outraged, and slighted, and 
had dirty water from ditches given him to shave with, and wept 
and said he would have clean warm water, and was altogether very 
miserable.&nbsp; He was moved from this castle to that castle, 
and from that castle to the other castle, because this lord or 
that lord, or the other lord, was too kind to him: until at last 
he came to Berkeley Castle, near the River Severn, where (the 
Lord Berkeley being then ill and absent) he fell into the hands 
of two black ruffians, called <span class="smcap">Thomas 
Gournay</span> and <span class="smcap">William Ogle</span>.</p>
<p>One night&mdash;it was the night of September the 
twenty-first, one thousand three hundred and 
twenty-seven&mdash;dreadful screams were heard, by the startled 
people in the neighbouring town, ringing through the thick walls 
of the Castle, and the dark, deep night; and they said, as they 
were thus horribly awakened from their sleep, &lsquo;May Heaven 
be merciful to the King; for those cries forbode that no good is 
being done to him in his dismal prison!&rsquo;&nbsp; Next morning
he was dead&mdash;not bruised, or stabbed, or marked upon the 
body, but much distorted in the face; and it was whispered 
afterwards, that those two villains, Gournay and Ogle, had burnt 
up his inside with a red-hot iron.</p>
<p>If you ever come near Gloucester, and see the centre tower of 
its beautiful Cathedral, with its four rich pinnacles, rising 
lightly in the air; you may remember that the wretched Edward the
Second was buried in the old abbey of that ancient city, at 
forty-three years old, after being for nineteen years and a half 
a perfectly incapable King.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE THIRD</h2>
<p>Roger Mortimer, the Queen&rsquo;s lover (who escaped to France
in the last chapter), was far from profiting by the examples he 
had had of the fate of favourites.&nbsp; Having, through the 
Queen&rsquo;s influence, come into possession of the estates of 
the two Despensers, he became extremely proud and ambitious, and 
sought to be the real ruler of England.&nbsp; The young King, who
was crowned at fourteen years of age with all the usual 
solemnities, resolved not to bear this, and soon pursued Mortimer
to his ruin.</p>
<p>The people themselves were not fond of Mortimer&mdash;first, 
because he was a Royal favourite; secondly, because he was 
supposed to have helped to make a peace with Scotland which now 
took place, and in virtue of which the young King&rsquo;s sister 
Joan, only seven years old, was promised in marriage to David, 
the son and heir of Robert Bruce, who was only five years 
old.&nbsp; The nobles hated Mortimer because of his pride, 
riches, and power.&nbsp; They went so far as to take up arms 
against him; but were obliged to submit.&nbsp; The Earl of Kent, 
one of those who did so, but who afterwards went over to Mortimer
and the Queen, was made an example of in the following cruel 
manner:</p>
<p>He seems to have been anything but a wise old earl; and he was
persuaded by the agents of the favourite and the Queen, that poor
King Edward the Second was not really dead; and thus was betrayed
into writing letters favouring his rightful claim to the 
throne.&nbsp; This was made out to be high treason, and he was 
tried, found guilty, and sentenced to be executed.&nbsp; They 
took the poor old lord outside the town of Winchester, and there 
kept him waiting some three or four hours until they could find 
somebody to cut off his head.&nbsp; At last, a convict said he 
would do it, if the government would pardon him in return; and 
they gave him the pardon; and at one blow he put the Earl of Kent
out of his last suspense.</p>
<p>While the Queen was in France, she had found a lovely and good
young lady, named Philippa, who she thought would make an 
excellent wife for her son.&nbsp; The young King married this 
lady, soon after he came to the throne; and her first child, 
Edward, Prince of Wales, afterwards became celebrated, as we 
shall presently see, under the famous title of <span 
class="smcap">Edward the Black Prince</span>.</p>
<p>The young King, thinking the time ripe for the downfall of 
Mortimer, took counsel with Lord Montacute how he should 
proceed.&nbsp; A Parliament was going to be held at Nottingham, 
and that lord recommended that the favourite should be seized by 
night in Nottingham Castle, where he was sure to be.&nbsp; Now, 
this, like many other things, was more easily said than done; 
because, to guard against treachery, the great gates of the 
Castle were locked every night, and the great keys were carried 
up-stairs to the Queen, who laid them under her own pillow.&nbsp;
But the Castle had a governor, and the governor being Lord 
Montacute&rsquo;s friend, confided to him how he knew of a secret
passage underground, hidden from observation by the weeds and 
brambles with which it was overgrown; and how, through that 
passage, the conspirators might enter in the dead of the night, 
and go straight to Mortimer&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Accordingly, upon
a certain dark night, at midnight, they made their way through 
this dismal place: startling the rats, and frightening the owls 
and bats: and came safely to the bottom of the main tower of the 
Castle, where the King met them, and took them up a 
profoundly-dark staircase in a deep silence.&nbsp; They soon 
heard the voice of Mortimer in council with some friends; and 
bursting into the room with a sudden noise, took him 
prisoner.&nbsp; The Queen cried out from her bed-chamber, 
&lsquo;Oh, my sweet son, my dear son, spare my gentle 
Mortimer!&rsquo;&nbsp; They carried him off, however; and, before
the next Parliament, accused him of having made differences 
between the young King and his mother, and of having brought 
about the death of the Earl of Kent, and even of the late King; 
for, as you know by this time, when they wanted to get rid of a 
man in those old days, they were not very particular of what they
accused him.&nbsp; Mortimer was found guilty of all this, and was
sentenced to be hanged at Tyburn.&nbsp; The King shut his mother 
up in genteel confinement, where she passed the rest of her life;
and now he became King in earnest.</p>
<p>The first effort he made was to conquer Scotland.&nbsp; The 
English lords who had lands in Scotland, finding that their 
rights were not respected under the late peace, made war on their
own account: choosing for their general, Edward, the son of John 
Baliol, who made such a vigorous fight, that in less than two 
months he won the whole Scottish Kingdom.&nbsp; He was joined, 
when thus triumphant, by the King and Parliament; and he and the 
King in person besieged the Scottish forces in Berwick.&nbsp; The
whole Scottish army coming to the assistance of their countrymen,
such a furious battle ensued, that thirty thousand men are said 
to have been killed in it.&nbsp; Baliol was then crowned King of 
Scotland, doing homage to the King of England; but little came of
his successes after all, for the Scottish men rose against him, 
within no very long time, and David Bruce came back within ten 
years and took his kingdom.</p>
<p>France was a far richer country than Scotland, and the King 
had a much greater mind to conquer it.&nbsp; So, he let Scotland 
alone, and pretended that he had a claim to the French throne in 
right of his mother.&nbsp; He had, in reality, no claim at all; 
but that mattered little in those times.&nbsp; He brought over to
his cause many little princes and sovereigns, and even courted 
the alliance of the people of Flanders&mdash;a busy, working 
community, who had very small respect for kings, and whose head 
man was a brewer.&nbsp; With such forces as he raised by these 
means, Edward invaded France; but he did little by that, except 
run into debt in carrying on the war to the extent of three 
hundred thousand pounds.&nbsp; The next year he did better; 
gaining a great sea-fight in the harbour of Sluys.&nbsp; This 
success, however, was very shortlived, for the Flemings took 
fright at the siege of Saint Omer and ran away, leaving their 
weapons and baggage behind them.&nbsp; Philip, the French King, 
coming up with his army, and Edward being very anxious to decide 
the war, proposed to settle the difference by single combat with 
him, or by a fight of one hundred knights on each side.&nbsp; The
French King said, he thanked him; but being very well as he was, 
he would rather not.&nbsp; So, after some skirmishing and 
talking, a short peace was made.</p>
<p>It was soon broken by King Edward&rsquo;s favouring the cause 
of John, Earl of Montford; a French nobleman, who asserted a 
claim of his own against the French King, and offered to do 
homage to England for the Crown of France, if he could obtain it 
through England&rsquo;s help.&nbsp; This French lord, himself, 
was soon defeated by the French King&rsquo;s son, and shut up in 
a tower in Paris; but his wife, a courageous and beautiful woman,
who is said to have had the courage of a man, and the heart of a 
lion, assembled the people of Brittany, where she then was; and, 
showing them her infant son, made many pathetic entreaties to 
them not to desert her and their young Lord.&nbsp; They took fire
at this appeal, and rallied round her in the strong castle of 
Hennebon.&nbsp; Here she was not only besieged without by the 
French under Charles de Blois, but was endangered within by a 
dreary old bishop, who was always representing to the people what
horrors they must undergo if they were faithful&mdash;first from 
famine, and afterwards from fire and sword.&nbsp; But this noble 
lady, whose heart never failed her, encouraged her soldiers by 
her own example; went from post to post like a great general; 
even mounted on horseback fully armed, and, issuing from the 
castle by a by-path, fell upon the French camp, set fire to the 
tents, and threw the whole force into disorder.&nbsp; This done, 
she got safely back to Hennebon again, and was received with loud
shouts of joy by the defenders of the castle, who had given her 
up for lost.&nbsp; As they were now very short of provisions, 
however, and as they could not dine off enthusiasm, and as the 
old bishop was always saying, &lsquo;I told you what it would 
come to!&rsquo; they began to lose heart, and to talk of yielding
the castle up.&nbsp; The brave Countess retiring to an upper room
and looking with great grief out to sea, where she expected 
relief from England, saw, at this very time, the English ships in
the distance, and was relieved and rescued!&nbsp; Sir Walter 
Manning, the English commander, so admired her courage, that, 
being come into the castle with the English knights, and having 
made a feast there, he assaulted the French by way of dessert, 
and beat them off triumphantly.&nbsp; Then he and the knights 
came back to the castle with great joy; and the Countess who had 
watched them from a high tower, thanked them with all her heart, 
and kissed them every one.</p>
<p>This noble lady distinguished herself afterwards in a 
sea-fight with the French off Guernsey, when she was on her way 
to England to ask for more troops.&nbsp; Her great spirit roused 
another lady, the wife of another French lord (whom the French 
King very barbarously murdered), to distinguish herself scarcely 
less.&nbsp; The time was fast coming, however, when Edward, 
Prince of Wales, was to be the great star of this French and 
English war.</p>
<p>It was in the month of July, in the year one thousand three 
hundred and forty-six, when the King embarked at Southampton for 
France, with an army of about thirty thousand men in all, 
attended by the Prince of Wales and by several of the chief 
nobles.&nbsp; He landed at La Hogue in Normandy; and, burning and
destroying as he went, according to custom, advanced up the left 
bank of the River Seine, and fired the small towns even close to 
Paris; but, being watched from the right bank of the river by the
French King and all his army, it came to this at last, that 
Edward found himself, on Saturday the twenty-sixth of August, one
thousand three hundred and forty-six, on a rising ground behind 
the little French village of Crecy, face to face with the French 
King&rsquo;s force.&nbsp; And, although the French King had an 
enormous army&mdash;in number more than eight times his&mdash;he 
there resolved to beat him or be beaten.</p>
<p>The young Prince, assisted by the Earl of Oxford and the Earl 
of Warwick, led the first division of the English army; two other
great Earls led the second; and the King, the third.&nbsp; When 
the morning dawned, the King received the sacrament, and heard 
prayers, and then, mounted on horseback with a white wand in his 
hand, rode from company to company, and rank to rank, cheering 
and encouraging both officers and men.&nbsp; Then the whole army 
breakfasted, each man sitting on the ground where he had stood; 
and then they remained quietly on the ground with their weapons 
ready.</p>
<p>Up came the French King with all his great force.&nbsp; It was
dark and angry weather; there was an eclipse of the sun; there 
was a thunder-storm, accompanied with tremendous rain; the 
frightened birds flew screaming above the soldiers&rsquo; 
heads.&nbsp; A certain captain in the French army advised the 
French King, who was by no means cheerful, not to begin the 
battle until the morrow.&nbsp; The King, taking this advice, gave
the word to halt.&nbsp; But, those behind not understanding it, 
or desiring to be foremost with the rest, came pressing on.&nbsp;
The roads for a great distance were covered with this immense 
army, and with the common people from the villages, who were 
flourishing their rude weapons, and making a great noise.&nbsp; 
Owing to these circumstances, the French army advanced in the 
greatest confusion; every French lord doing what he liked with 
his own men, and putting out the men of every other French 
lord.</p>
<p>Now, their King relied strongly upon a great body of 
cross-bowmen from Genoa; and these he ordered to the front to 
begin the battle, on finding that he could not stop it.&nbsp; 
They shouted once, they shouted twice, they shouted three times, 
to alarm the English archers; but, the English would have heard 
them shout three thousand times and would have never moved.&nbsp;
At last the cross-bowmen went forward a little, and began to 
discharge their bolts; upon which, the English let fly such a 
hail of arrows, that the Genoese speedily made off&mdash;for 
their cross-bows, besides being heavy to carry, required to be 
wound up with a handle, and consequently took time to re-load; 
the English, on the other hand, could discharge their arrows 
almost as fast as the arrows could fly.</p>
<p>When the French King saw the Genoese turning, he cried out to 
his men to kill those scoundrels, who were doing harm instead of 
service.&nbsp; This increased the confusion.&nbsp; Meanwhile the 
English archers, continuing to shoot as fast as ever, shot down 
great numbers of the French soldiers and knights; whom certain 
sly Cornish-men and Welshmen, from the English army, creeping 
along the ground, despatched with great knives.</p>
<p>The Prince and his division were at this time so hard-pressed,
that the Earl of Warwick sent a message to the King, who was 
overlooking the battle from a windmill, beseeching him to send 
more aid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is my son killed?&rsquo; said the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sire, please God,&rsquo; returned the 
messenger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he wounded?&rsquo; said the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he thrown to the ground?&rsquo; said the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sire, not so; but, he is very 
hard-pressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;go back to those who
sent you, and tell them I shall send no aid; because I set my 
heart upon my son proving himself this day a brave knight, and 
because I am resolved, please God, that the honour of a great 
victory shall be his!&rsquo;</p>
<p>These bold words, being reported to the Prince and his 
division, so raised their spirits, that they fought better than 
ever.&nbsp; The King of France charged gallantly with his men 
many times; but it was of no use.&nbsp; Night closing in, his 
horse was killed under him by an English arrow, and the knights 
and nobles who had clustered thick about him early in the day, 
were now completely scattered.&nbsp; At last, some of his few 
remaining followers led him off the field by force since he would
not retire of himself, and they journeyed away to Amiens.&nbsp; 
The victorious English, lighting their watch-fires, made merry on
the field, and the King, riding to meet his gallant son, took him
in his arms, kissed him, and told him that he had acted nobly, 
and proved himself worthy of the day and of the crown.&nbsp; 
While it was yet night, King Edward was hardly aware of the great
victory he had gained; but, next day, it was discovered that 
eleven princes, twelve hundred knights, and thirty thousand 
common men lay dead upon the French side.&nbsp; Among these was 
the King of Bohemia, an old blind man; who, having been told that
his son was wounded in the battle, and that no force could stand 
against the Black Prince, called to him two knights, put himself 
on horse-back between them, fastened the three bridles together, 
and dashed in among the English, where he was presently 
slain.&nbsp; He bore as his crest three white ostrich feathers, 
with the motto <i>Ich dien</i>, signifying in English &lsquo;I 
serve.&rsquo;&nbsp; This crest and motto were taken by the Prince
of Wales in remembrance of that famous day, and have been borne 
by the Prince of Wales ever since.</p>
<p>Five days after this great battle, the King laid siege to 
Calais.&nbsp; This siege&mdash;ever afterwards 
memorable&mdash;lasted nearly a year.&nbsp; In order to starve 
the inhabitants out, King Edward built so many wooden houses for 
the lodgings of his troops, that it is said their quarters looked
like a second Calais suddenly sprung around the first.&nbsp; 
Early in the siege, the governor of the town drove out what he 
called the useless mouths, to the number of seventeen hundred 
persons, men and women, young and old.&nbsp; King Edward allowed 
them to pass through his lines, and even fed them, and dismissed 
them with money; but, later in the siege, he was not so 
merciful&mdash;five hundred more, who were afterwards driven out,
dying of starvation and misery.&nbsp; The garrison were so 
hard-pressed at last, that they sent a letter to King Philip, 
telling him that they had eaten all the horses, all the dogs, and
all the rats and mice that could be found in the place; and, that
if he did not relieve them, they must either surrender to the 
English, or eat one another.&nbsp; Philip made one effort to give
them relief; but they were so hemmed in by the English power, 
that he could not succeed, and was fain to leave the place.&nbsp;
Upon this they hoisted the English flag, and surrendered to King 
Edward.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell your general,&rsquo; said he to the 
humble messengers who came out of the town, &lsquo;that I require
to have sent here, six of the most distinguished citizens, 
bare-legged, and in their shirts, with ropes about their necks; 
and let those six men bring with them the keys of the castle and 
the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the Governor of Calais related this to the people in the 
Market-place, there was great weeping and distress; in the midst 
of which, one worthy citizen, named Eustace de Saint Pierre, rose
up and said, that if the six men required were not sacrificed, 
the whole population would be; therefore, he offered himself as 
the first.&nbsp; Encouraged by this bright example, five other 
worthy citizens rose up one after another, and offered themselves
to save the rest.&nbsp; The Governor, who was too badly wounded 
to be able to walk, mounted a poor old horse that had not been 
eaten, and conducted these good men to the gate, while all the 
people cried and mourned.</p>
<p>Edward received them wrathfully, and ordered the heads of the 
whole six to be struck off.&nbsp; However, the good Queen fell 
upon her knees, and besought the King to give them up to 
her.&nbsp; The King replied, &lsquo;I wish you had been somewhere
else; but I cannot refuse you.&rsquo;&nbsp; So she had them 
properly dressed, made a feast for them, and sent them back with 
a handsome present, to the great rejoicing of the whole 
camp.&nbsp; I hope the people of Calais loved the daughter to 
whom she gave birth soon afterwards, for her gentle 
mother&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Now came that terrible disease, the Plague, into Europe, 
hurrying from the heart of China; and killed the wretched 
people&mdash;especially the poor&mdash;in such enormous numbers, 
that one-half of the inhabitants of England are related to have 
died of it.&nbsp; It killed the cattle, in great numbers, too; 
and so few working men remained alive, that there were not enough
left to till the ground.</p>
<p>After eight years of differing and quarrelling, the Prince of 
Wales again invaded France with an army of sixty thousand 
men.&nbsp; He went through the south of the country, burning and 
plundering wheresoever he went; while his father, who had still 
the Scottish war upon his hands, did the like in Scotland, but 
was harassed and worried in his retreat from that country by the 
Scottish men, who repaid his cruelties with interest.</p>
<p>The French King, Philip, was now dead, and was succeeded by 
his son John.&nbsp; The Black Prince, called by that name from 
the colour of the armour he wore to set off his fair complexion, 
continuing to burn and destroy in France, roused John into 
determined opposition; and so cruel had the Black Prince been in 
his campaign, and so severely had the French peasants suffered, 
that he could not find one who, for love, or money, or the fear 
of death, would tell him what the French King was doing, or where
he was.&nbsp; Thus it happened that he came upon the French 
King&rsquo;s forces, all of a sudden, near the town of Poitiers, 
and found that the whole neighbouring country was occupied by a 
vast French army.&nbsp; &lsquo;God help us!&rsquo; said the Black
Prince, &lsquo;we must make the best of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, on a Sunday morning, the eighteenth of September, the 
Prince whose army was now reduced to ten thousand men in 
all&mdash;prepared to give battle to the French King, who had 
sixty thousand horse alone.&nbsp; While he was so engaged, there 
came riding from the French camp, a Cardinal, who had persuaded 
John to let him offer terms, and try to save the shedding of 
Christian blood.&nbsp; &lsquo;Save my honour,&rsquo; said the 
Prince to this good priest, &lsquo;and save the honour of my 
army, and I will make any reasonable terms.&rsquo;&nbsp; He 
offered to give up all the towns, castles, and prisoners, he had 
taken, and to swear to make no war in France for seven years; 
but, as John would hear of nothing but his surrender, with a 
hundred of his chief knights, the treaty was broken off, and the 
Prince said quietly&mdash;&lsquo;God defend the right; we shall 
fight to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, on the Monday morning, at break of day, the two 
armies prepared for battle.&nbsp; The English were posted in a 
strong place, which could only be approached by one narrow lane, 
skirted by hedges on both sides.&nbsp; The French attacked them 
by this lane; but were so galled and slain by English arrows from
behind the hedges, that they were forced to retreat.&nbsp; Then 
went six hundred English bowmen round about, and, coming upon the
rear of the French army, rained arrows on them thick and 
fast.&nbsp; The French knights, thrown into confusion, quitted 
their banners and dispersed in all directions.&nbsp; Said Sir 
John Chandos to the Prince, &lsquo;Ride forward, noble Prince, 
and the day is yours.&nbsp; The King of France is so valiant a 
gentleman, that I know he will never fly, and may be taken 
prisoner.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Prince to this, &lsquo;Advance, 
English banners, in the name of God and St. George!&rsquo; and on
they pressed until they came up with the French King, fighting 
fiercely with his battle-axe, and, when all his nobles had 
forsaken him, attended faithfully to the last by his youngest son
Philip, only sixteen years of age.&nbsp; Father and son fought 
well, and the King had already two wounds in his face, and had 
been beaten down, when he at last delivered himself to a banished
French knight, and gave him his right-hand glove in token that he
had done so.</p>
<p>The Black Prince was generous as well as brave, and he invited
his royal prisoner to supper in his tent, and waited upon him at 
table, and, when they afterwards rode into London in a gorgeous 
procession, mounted the French King on a fine cream-coloured 
horse, and rode at his side on a little pony.&nbsp; This was all 
very kind, but I think it was, perhaps, a little theatrical too, 
and has been made more meritorious than it deserved to be; 
especially as I am inclined to think that the greatest kindness 
to the King of France would have been not to have shown him to 
the people at all.&nbsp; However, it must be said, for these acts
of politeness, that, in course of time, they did much to soften 
the horrors of war and the passions of conquerors.&nbsp; It was a
long, long time before the common soldiers began to have the 
benefit of such courtly deeds; but they did at last; and thus it 
is possible that a poor soldier who asked for quarter at the 
battle of Waterloo, or any other such great fight, may have owed 
his life indirectly to Edward the Black Prince.</p>
<p>At this time there stood in the Strand, in London, a palace 
called the Savoy, which was given up to the captive King of 
France and his son for their residence.&nbsp; As the King of 
Scotland had now been King Edward&rsquo;s captive for eleven 
years too, his success was, at this time, tolerably 
complete.&nbsp; The Scottish business was settled by the prisoner
being released under the title of Sir David, King of Scotland, 
and by his engaging to pay a large ransom.&nbsp; The state of 
France encouraged England to propose harder terms to that 
country, where the people rose against the unspeakable cruelty 
and barbarity of its nobles; where the nobles rose in turn 
against the people; where the most frightful outrages were 
committed on all sides; and where the insurrection of the 
peasants, called the insurrection of the Jacquerie, from Jacques,
a common Christian name among the country people of France, 
awakened terrors and hatreds that have scarcely yet passed 
away.&nbsp; A treaty called the Great Peace, was at last signed, 
under which King Edward agreed to give up the greater part of his
conquests, and King John to pay, within six years, a ransom of 
three million crowns of gold.&nbsp; He was so beset by his own 
nobles and courtiers for having yielded to these 
conditions&mdash;though they could help him to no 
better&mdash;that he came back of his own will to his old 
palace-prison of the Savoy, and there died.</p>
<p>There was a Sovereign of Castile at that time, called <span 
class="smcap">Pedro the Cruel</span>, who deserved the name 
remarkably well: having committed, among other cruelties, a 
variety of murders.&nbsp; This amiable monarch being driven from 
his throne for his crimes, went to the province of Bordeaux, 
where the Black Prince&mdash;now married to his cousin <span 
class="smcap">Joan</span>, a pretty widow&mdash;was residing, and
besought his help.&nbsp; The Prince, who took to him much more 
kindly than a prince of such fame ought to have taken to such a 
ruffian, readily listened to his fair promises, and agreeing to 
help him, sent secret orders to some troublesome disbanded 
soldiers of his and his father&rsquo;s, who called themselves the
Free Companions, and who had been a pest to the French people, 
for some time, to aid this Pedro.&nbsp; The Prince, himself, 
going into Spain to head the army of relief, soon set Pedro on 
his throne again&mdash;where he no sooner found himself, than, of
course, he behaved like the villain he was, broke his word 
without the least shame, and abandoned all the promises he had 
made to the Black Prince.</p>
<p>Now, it had cost the Prince a good deal of money to pay 
soldiers to support this murderous King; and finding himself, 
when he came back disgusted to Bordeaux, not only in bad health, 
but deeply in debt, he began to tax his French subjects to pay 
his creditors.&nbsp; They appealed to the French King, <span 
class="smcap">Charles</span>; war again broke out; and the French
town of Limoges, which the Prince had greatly benefited, went 
over to the French King.&nbsp; Upon this he ravaged the province 
of which it was the capital; burnt, and plundered, and killed in 
the old sickening way; and refused mercy to the prisoners, men, 
women, and children taken in the offending town, though he was so
ill and so much in need of pity himself from Heaven, that he was 
carried in a litter.&nbsp; He lived to come home and make himself
popular with the people and Parliament, and he died on Trinity 
Sunday, the eighth of June, one thousand three hundred and 
seventy-six, at forty-six years old.</p>
<p>The whole nation mourned for him as one of the most renowned 
and beloved princes it had ever had; and he was buried with great
lamentations in Canterbury Cathedral.&nbsp; Near to the tomb of 
Edward the Confessor, his monument, with his figure, carved in 
stone, and represented in the old black armour, lying on its 
back, may be seen at this day, with an ancient coat of mail, a 
helmet, and a pair of gauntlets hanging from a beam above it, 
which most people like to believe were once worn by the Black 
Prince.</p>
<p>King Edward did not outlive his renowned son, long.&nbsp; He 
was old, and one Alice Perrers, a beautiful lady, had contrived 
to make him so fond of her in his old age, that he could refuse 
her nothing, and made himself ridiculous.&nbsp; She little 
deserved his love, or&mdash;what I dare say she valued a great 
deal more&mdash;the jewels of the late Queen, which he gave her 
among other rich presents.&nbsp; She took the very ring from his 
finger on the morning of the day when he died, and left him to be
pillaged by his faithless servants.&nbsp; Only one good priest 
was true to him, and attended him to the last.</p>
<p>Besides being famous for the great victories I have related, 
the reign of King Edward the Third was rendered memorable in 
better ways, by the growth of architecture and the erection of 
Windsor Castle.&nbsp; In better ways still, by the rising up of 
<span class="smcap">Wickliffe</span>, originally a poor parish 
priest: who devoted himself to exposing, with wonderful power and
success, the ambition and corruption of the Pope, and of the 
whole church of which he was the head.</p>
<p>Some of those Flemings were induced to come to England in this
reign too, and to settle in Norfolk, where they made better 
woollen cloths than the English had ever had before.&nbsp; The 
Order of the Garter (a very fine thing in its way, but hardly so 
important as good clothes for the nation) also dates from this 
period.&nbsp; The King is said to have picked &lsquo;up a 
lady&rsquo;s garter at a ball, and to have said, <i>Honi soit qui
mal y pense</i>&mdash;in English, &lsquo;Evil be to him who evil 
thinks of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The courtiers were usually glad to 
imitate what the King said or did, and hence from a slight 
incident the Order of the Garter was instituted, and became a 
great dignity.&nbsp; So the story goes.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE SECOND</h2>
<p>Richard, son of the Black Prince, a boy eleven years of age, 
succeeded to the Crown under the title of King Richard the 
Second.&nbsp; The whole English nation were ready to admire him 
for the sake of his brave father.&nbsp; As to the lords and 
ladies about the Court, they declared him to be the most 
beautiful, the wisest, and the best&mdash;even of 
princes&mdash;whom the lords and ladies about the Court, 
generally declare to be the most beautiful, the wisest, and the 
best of mankind.&nbsp; To flatter a poor boy in this base manner 
was not a very likely way to develop whatever good was in him; 
and it brought him to anything but a good or happy end.</p>
<p>The Duke of Lancaster, the young King&rsquo;s 
uncle&mdash;commonly called John of Gaunt, from having been born 
at Ghent, which the common people so pronounced&mdash;was 
supposed to have some thoughts of the throne himself; but, as he 
was not popular, and the memory of the Black Prince was, he 
submitted to his nephew.</p>
<p>The war with France being still unsettled, the Government of 
England wanted money to provide for the expenses that might arise
out of it; accordingly a certain tax, called the Poll-tax, which 
had originated in the last reign, was ordered to be levied on the
people.&nbsp; This was a tax on every person in the kingdom, male
and female, above the age of fourteen, of three groats (or three 
four-penny pieces) a year; clergymen were charged more, and only 
beggars were exempt.</p>
<p>I have no need to repeat that the common people of England had
long been suffering under great oppression.&nbsp; They were still
the mere slaves of the lords of the land on which they lived, and
were on most occasions harshly and unjustly treated.&nbsp; But, 
they had begun by this time to think very seriously of not 
bearing quite so much; and, probably, were emboldened by that 
French insurrection I mentioned in the last chapter.</p>
<p>The people of Essex rose against the Poll-tax, and being 
severely handled by the government officers, killed some of 
them.&nbsp; At this very time one of the tax-collectors, going 
his rounds from house to house, at Dartford in Kent came to the 
cottage of one <span class="smcap">Wat</span>, a tiler by trade, 
and claimed the tax upon his daughter.&nbsp; Her mother, who was 
at home, declared that she was under the age of fourteen; upon 
that, the collector (as other collectors had already done in 
different parts of England) behaved in a savage way, and brutally
insulted Wat Tyler&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; The daughter screamed,
the mother screamed.&nbsp; Wat the Tiler, who was at work not far
off, ran to the spot, and did what any honest father under such 
provocation might have done&mdash;struck the collector dead at a 
blow.</p>
<p>Instantly the people of that town uprose as one man.&nbsp; 
They made Wat Tyler their leader; they joined with the people of 
Essex, who were in arms under a priest called <span 
class="smcap">Jack Straw</span>; they took out of prison another 
priest named <span class="smcap">John Ball</span>; and gathering 
in numbers as they went along, advanced, in a great confused army
of poor men, to Blackheath.&nbsp; It is said that they wanted to 
abolish all property, and to declare all men equal.&nbsp; I do 
not think this very likely; because they stopped the travellers 
on the roads and made them swear to be true to King Richard and 
the people.&nbsp; Nor were they at all disposed to injure those 
who had done them no harm, merely because they were of high 
station; for, the King&rsquo;s mother, who had to pass through 
their camp at Blackheath, on her way to her young son, lying for 
safety in the Tower of London, had merely to kiss a few 
dirty-faced rough-bearded men who were noisily fond of royalty, 
and so got away in perfect safety.&nbsp; Next day the whole mass 
marched on to London Bridge.</p>
<p>There was a drawbridge in the middle, which <span 
class="smcap">William Walworth</span> the Mayor caused to be 
raised to prevent their coming into the city; but they soon 
terrified the citizens into lowering it again, and spread 
themselves, with great uproar, over the streets.&nbsp; They broke
open the prisons; they burned the papers in Lambeth Palace; they 
destroyed the <span class="smcap">Duke of 
Lancaster&rsquo;s</span> Palace, the Savoy, in the Strand, said 
to be the most beautiful and splendid in England; they set fire 
to the books and documents in the Temple; and made a great 
riot.&nbsp; Many of these outrages were committed in drunkenness;
since those citizens, who had well-filled cellars, were only too 
glad to throw them open to save the rest of their property; but 
even the drunken rioters were very careful to steal 
nothing.&nbsp; They were so angry with one man, who was seen to 
take a silver cup at the Savoy Palace, and put it in his breast, 
that they drowned him in the river, cup and all.</p>
<p>The young King had been taken out to treat with them before 
they committed these excesses; but, he and the people about him 
were so frightened by the riotous shouts, that they got back to 
the Tower in the best way they could.&nbsp; This made the 
insurgents bolder; so they went on rioting away, striking off the
heads of those who did not, at a moment&rsquo;s notice, declare 
for King Richard and the people; and killing as many of the 
unpopular persons whom they supposed to be their enemies as they 
could by any means lay hold of.&nbsp; In this manner they passed 
one very violent day, and then proclamation was made that the 
King would meet them at Mile-end, and grant their requests.</p>
<p>The rioters went to Mile-end to the number of sixty thousand, 
and the King met them there, and to the King the rioters 
peaceably proposed four conditions.&nbsp; First, that neither 
they, nor their children, nor any coming after them, should be 
made slaves any more.&nbsp; Secondly, that the rent of land 
should be fixed at a certain price in money, instead of being 
paid in service.&nbsp; Thirdly, that they should have liberty to 
buy and sell in all markets and public places, like other free 
men.&nbsp; Fourthly, that they should be pardoned for past 
offences.&nbsp; Heaven knows, there was nothing very unreasonable
in these proposals!&nbsp; The young King deceitfully pretended to
think so, and kept thirty clerks up, all night, writing out a 
charter accordingly.</p>
<p>Now, Wat Tyler himself wanted more than this.&nbsp; He wanted 
the entire abolition of the forest laws.&nbsp; He was not at 
Mile-end with the rest, but, while that meeting was being held, 
broke into the Tower of London and slew the archbishop and the 
treasurer, for whose heads the people had cried out loudly the 
day before.&nbsp; He and his men even thrust their swords into 
the bed of the Princess of Wales while the Princess was in it, to
make certain that none of their enemies were concealed there.</p>
<p>So, Wat and his men still continued armed, and rode about the 
city.&nbsp; Next morning, the King with a small train of some 
sixty gentlemen&mdash;among whom was <span 
class="smcap">Walworth</span> the Mayor&mdash;rode into 
Smithfield, and saw Wat and his people at a little 
distance.&nbsp; Says Wat to his men, &lsquo;There is the 
King.&nbsp; I will go speak with him, and tell him what we 
want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Straightway Wat rode up to him, and began to talk.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;King,&rsquo; says Wat, &lsquo;dost thou see all my men 
there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; says Wat, &lsquo;they are all at my 
command, and have sworn to do whatever I bid them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some declared afterwards that as Wat said this, he laid his 
hand on the King&rsquo;s bridle.&nbsp; Others declared that he 
was seen to play with his own dagger.&nbsp; I think, myself, that
he just spoke to the King like a rough, angry man as he was, and 
did nothing more.&nbsp; At any rate he was expecting no attack, 
and preparing for no resistance, when Walworth the Mayor did the 
not very valiant deed of drawing a short sword and stabbing him 
in the throat.&nbsp; He dropped from his horse, and one of the 
King&rsquo;s people speedily finished him.&nbsp; So fell Wat 
Tyler.&nbsp; Fawners and flatterers made a mighty triumph of it, 
and set up a cry which will occasionally find an echo to this 
day.&nbsp; But Wat was a hard-working man, who had suffered much,
and had been foully outraged; and it is probable that he was a 
man of a much higher nature and a much braver spirit than any of 
the parasites who exulted then, or have exulted since, over his 
defeat.</p>
<p>Seeing Wat down, his men immediately bent their bows to avenge
his fall.&nbsp; If the young King had not had presence of mind at
that dangerous moment, both he and the Mayor to boot, might have 
followed Tyler pretty fast.&nbsp; But the King riding up to the 
crowd, cried out that Tyler was a traitor, and that he would be 
their leader.&nbsp; They were so taken by surprise, that they set
up a great shouting, and followed the boy until he was met at 
Islington by a large body of soldiers.</p>
<p>The end of this rising was the then usual end.&nbsp; As soon 
as the King found himself safe, he unsaid all he had said, and 
undid all he had done; some fifteen hundred of the rioters were 
tried (mostly in Essex) with great rigour, and executed with 
great cruelty.&nbsp; Many of them were hanged on gibbets, and 
left there as a terror to the country people; and, because their 
miserable friends took some of the bodies down to bury, the King 
ordered the rest to be chained up&mdash;which was the beginning 
of the barbarous custom of hanging in chains.&nbsp; The 
King&rsquo;s falsehood in this business makes such a pitiful 
figure, that I think Wat Tyler appears in history as beyond 
comparison the truer and more respectable man of the two.</p>
<p>Richard was now sixteen years of age, and married Anne of 
Bohemia, an excellent princess, who was called &lsquo;the good 
Queen Anne.&rsquo;&nbsp; She deserved a better husband; for the 
King had been fawned and flattered into a treacherous, wasteful, 
dissolute, bad young man.</p>
<p>There were two Popes at this time (as if one were not 
enough!), and their quarrels involved Europe in a great deal of 
trouble.&nbsp; Scotland was still troublesome too; and at home 
there was much jealousy and distrust, and plotting and 
counter-plotting, because the King feared the ambition of his 
relations, and particularly of his uncle, the Duke of Lancaster, 
and the duke had his party against the King, and the King had his
party against the duke.&nbsp; Nor were these home troubles 
lessened when the duke went to Castile to urge his claim to the 
crown of that kingdom; for then the Duke of Gloucester, another 
of Richard&rsquo;s uncles, opposed him, and influenced the 
Parliament to demand the dismissal of the King&rsquo;s favourite 
ministers.&nbsp; The King said in reply, that he would not for 
such men dismiss the meanest servant in his kitchen.&nbsp; But, 
it had begun to signify little what a King said when a Parliament
was determined; so Richard was at last obliged to give way, and 
to agree to another Government of the kingdom, under a commission
of fourteen nobles, for a year.&nbsp; His uncle of Gloucester was
at the head of this commission, and, in fact, appointed everybody
composing it.</p>
<p>Having done all this, the King declared as soon as he saw an 
opportunity that he had never meant to do it, and that it was all
illegal; and he got the judges secretly to sign a declaration to 
that effect.&nbsp; The secret oozed out directly, and was carried
to the Duke of Gloucester.&nbsp; The Duke of Gloucester, at the 
head of forty thousand men, met the King on his entering into 
London to enforce his authority; the King was helpless against 
him; his favourites and ministers were impeached and were 
mercilessly executed.&nbsp; Among them were two men whom the 
people regarded with very different feelings; one, Robert 
Tresilian, Chief Justice, who was hated for having made what was 
called &lsquo;the bloody circuit&rsquo; to try the rioters; the 
other, Sir Simon Burley, an honourable knight, who had been the 
dear friend of the Black Prince, and the governor and guardian of
the King.&nbsp; For this gentleman&rsquo;s life the good Queen 
even begged of Gloucester on her knees; but Gloucester (with or 
without reason) feared and hated him, and replied, that if she 
valued her husband&rsquo;s crown, she had better beg no 
more.&nbsp; All this was done under what was called by some the 
wonderful&mdash;and by others, with better reason, the 
merciless&mdash;Parliament.</p>
<p>But Gloucester&rsquo;s power was not to last for ever.&nbsp; 
He held it for only a year longer; in which year the famous 
battle of Otterbourne, sung in the old ballad of Chevy Chase, was
fought.&nbsp; When the year was out, the King, turning suddenly 
to Gloucester, in the midst of a great council said, 
&lsquo;Uncle, how old am I?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your 
highness,&rsquo; returned the Duke, &lsquo;is in your 
twenty-second year.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Am I so much?&rsquo; said
the King; &lsquo;then I will manage my own affairs!&nbsp; I am 
much obliged to you, my good lords, for your past services, but I
need them no more.&rsquo;&nbsp; He followed this up, by 
appointing a new Chancellor and a new Treasurer, and announced to
the people that he had resumed the Government.&nbsp; He held it 
for eight years without opposition.&nbsp; Through all that time, 
he kept his determination to revenge himself some day upon his 
uncle Gloucester, in his own breast.</p>
<p>At last the good Queen died, and then the King, desiring to 
take a second wife, proposed to his council that he should marry 
Isabella, of France, the daughter of Charles the Sixth: who, the 
French courtiers said (as the English courtiers had said of 
Richard), was a marvel of beauty and wit, and quite a 
phenomenon&mdash;of seven years old.&nbsp; The council were 
divided about this marriage, but it took place.&nbsp; It secured 
peace between England and France for a quarter of a century; but 
it was strongly opposed to the prejudices of the English 
people.&nbsp; The Duke of Gloucester, who was anxious to take the
occasion of making himself popular, declaimed against it loudly, 
and this at length decided the King to execute the vengeance he 
had been nursing so long.</p>
<p>He went with a gay company to the Duke of Gloucester&rsquo;s 
house, Pleshey Castle, in Essex, where the Duke, suspecting 
nothing, came out into the court-yard to receive his royal 
visitor.&nbsp; While the King conversed in a friendly manner with
the Duchess, the Duke was quietly seized, hurried away, shipped 
for Calais, and lodged in the castle there.&nbsp; His friends, 
the Earls of Arundel and Warwick, were taken in the same 
treacherous manner, and confined to their castles.&nbsp; A few 
days after, at Nottingham, they were impeached of high 
treason.&nbsp; The Earl of Arundel was condemned and beheaded, 
and the Earl of Warwick was banished.&nbsp; Then, a writ was sent
by a messenger to the Governor of Calais, requiring him to send 
the Duke of Gloucester over to be tried.&nbsp; In three days he 
returned an answer that he could not do that, because the Duke of
Gloucester had died in prison.&nbsp; The Duke was declared a 
traitor, his property was confiscated to the King, a real or 
pretended confession he had made in prison to one of the Justices
of the Common Pleas was produced against him, and there was an 
end of the matter.&nbsp; How the unfortunate duke died, very few 
cared to know.&nbsp; Whether he really died naturally; whether he
killed himself; whether, by the King&rsquo;s order, he was 
strangled, or smothered between two beds (as a serving-man of the
Governor&rsquo;s named Hall, did afterwards declare), cannot be 
discovered.&nbsp; There is not much doubt that he was killed, 
somehow or other, by his nephew&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; Among the 
most active nobles in these proceedings were the King&rsquo;s 
cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, whom the King had made Duke of 
Hereford to smooth down the old family quarrels, and some others:
who had in the family-plotting times done just such acts 
themselves as they now condemned in the duke.&nbsp; They seem to 
have been a corrupt set of men; but such men were easily found 
about the court in such days.</p>
<p>The people murmured at all this, and were still very sore 
about the French marriage.&nbsp; The nobles saw how little the 
King cared for law, and how crafty he was, and began to be 
somewhat afraid for themselves.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s life was a
life of continued feasting and excess; his retinue, down to the 
meanest servants, were dressed in the most costly manner, and 
caroused at his tables, it is related, to the number of ten 
thousand persons every day.&nbsp; He himself, surrounded by a 
body of ten thousand archers, and enriched by a duty on wool 
which the Commons had granted him for life, saw no danger of ever
being otherwise than powerful and absolute, and was as fierce and
haughty as a King could be.</p>
<p>He had two of his old enemies left, in the persons of the 
Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk.&nbsp; Sparing these no more than 
the others, he tampered with the Duke of Hereford until he got 
him to declare before the Council that the Duke of Norfolk had 
lately held some treasonable talk with him, as he was riding near
Brentford; and that he had told him, among other things, that he 
could not believe the King&rsquo;s oath&mdash;which nobody could,
I should think.&nbsp; For this treachery he obtained a pardon, 
and the Duke of Norfolk was summoned to appear and defend 
himself.&nbsp; As he denied the charge and said his accuser was a
liar and a traitor, both noblemen, according to the manner of 
those times, were held in custody, and the truth was ordered to 
be decided by wager of battle at Coventry.&nbsp; This wager of 
battle meant that whosoever won the combat was to be considered 
in the right; which nonsense meant in effect, that no strong man 
could ever be wrong.&nbsp; A great holiday was made; a great 
crowd assembled, with much parade and show; and the two 
combatants were about to rush at each other with their lances, 
when the King, sitting in a pavilion to see fair, threw down the 
truncheon he carried in his hand, and forbade the battle.&nbsp; 
The Duke of Hereford was to be banished for ten years, and the 
Duke of Norfolk was to be banished for life.&nbsp; So said the 
King.&nbsp; The Duke of Hereford went to France, and went no 
farther.&nbsp; The Duke of Norfolk made a pilgrimage to the Holy 
Land, and afterwards died at Venice of a broken heart.</p>
<p>Faster and fiercer, after this, the King went on in his 
career.&nbsp; The Duke of Lancaster, who was the father of the 
Duke of Hereford, died soon after the departure of his son; and, 
the King, although he had solemnly granted to that son leave to 
inherit his father&rsquo;s property, if it should come to him 
during his banishment, immediately seized it all, like a 
robber.&nbsp; The judges were so afraid of him, that they 
disgraced themselves by declaring this theft to be just and 
lawful.&nbsp; His avarice knew no bounds.&nbsp; He outlawed 
seventeen counties at once, on a frivolous pretence, merely to 
raise money by way of fines for misconduct.&nbsp; In short, he 
did as many dishonest things as he could; and cared so little for
the discontent of his subjects&mdash;though even the spaniel 
favourites began to whisper to him that there was such a thing as
discontent afloat&mdash;that he took that time, of all others, 
for leaving England and making an expedition against the 
Irish.</p>
<p>He was scarcely gone, leaving the <span class="smcap">Duke of 
York</span> Regent in his absence, when his cousin, Henry of 
Hereford, came over from France to claim the rights of which he 
had been so monstrously deprived.&nbsp; He was immediately joined
by the two great Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland; and 
his uncle, the Regent, finding the King&rsquo;s cause unpopular, 
and the disinclination of the army to act against Henry, very 
strong, withdrew with the Royal forces towards Bristol.&nbsp; 
Henry, at the head of an army, came from Yorkshire (where he had 
landed) to London and followed him.&nbsp; They joined their 
forces&mdash;how they brought that about, is not distinctly 
understood&mdash;and proceeded to Bristol Castle, whither three 
noblemen had taken the young Queen.&nbsp; The castle 
surrendering, they presently put those three noblemen to 
death.&nbsp; The Regent then remained there, and Henry went on to
Chester.</p>
<p>All this time, the boisterous weather had prevented the King 
from receiving intelligence of what had occurred.&nbsp; At length
it was conveyed to him in Ireland, and he sent over the <span 
class="smcap">Earl of Salisbury</span>, who, landing at Conway, 
rallied the Welshmen, and waited for the King a whole fortnight; 
at the end of that time the Welshmen, who were perhaps not very 
warm for him in the beginning, quite cooled down and went 
home.&nbsp; When the King did land on the coast at last, he came 
with a pretty good power, but his men cared nothing for him, and 
quickly deserted.&nbsp; Supposing the Welshmen to be still at 
Conway, he disguised himself as a priest, and made for that place
in company with his two brothers and some few of their 
adherents.&nbsp; But, there were no Welshmen left&mdash;only 
Salisbury and a hundred soldiers.&nbsp; In this distress, the 
King&rsquo;s two brothers, Exeter and Surrey, offered to go to 
Henry to learn what his intentions were.&nbsp; Surrey, who was 
true to Richard, was put into prison.&nbsp; Exeter, who was 
false, took the royal badge, which was a hart, off his shield, 
and assumed the rose, the badge of Henry.&nbsp; After this, it 
was pretty plain to the King what Henry&rsquo;s intentions were, 
without sending any more messengers to ask.</p>
<p>The fallen King, thus deserted&mdash;hemmed in on all sides, 
and pressed with hunger&mdash;rode here and rode there, and went 
to this castle, and went to that castle, endeavouring to obtain 
some provisions, but could find none.&nbsp; He rode wretchedly 
back to Conway, and there surrendered himself to the Earl of 
Northumberland, who came from Henry, in reality to take him 
prisoner, but in appearance to offer terms; and whose men were 
hidden not far off.&nbsp; By this earl he was conducted to the 
castle of Flint, where his cousin Henry met him, and dropped on 
his knee as if he were still respectful to his sovereign.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair cousin of Lancaster,&rsquo; said the King, 
&lsquo;you are very welcome&rsquo; (very welcome, no doubt; but 
he would have been more so, in chains or without a head).</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; replied Henry, &lsquo;I am come a 
little before my time; but, with your good pleasure, I will show 
you the reason.&nbsp; Your people complain with some bitterness, 
that you have ruled them rigorously for two-and-twenty 
years.&nbsp; Now, if it please God, I will help you to govern 
them better in future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair cousin,&rsquo; replied the abject King, 
&lsquo;since it pleaseth you, it pleaseth me mightily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this, the trumpets sounded, and the King was stuck on a 
wretched horse, and carried prisoner to Chester, where he was 
made to issue a proclamation, calling a Parliament.&nbsp; From 
Chester he was taken on towards London.&nbsp; At Lichfield he 
tried to escape by getting out of a window and letting himself 
down into a garden; it was all in vain, however, and he was 
carried on and shut up in the Tower, where no one pitied him, and
where the whole people, whose patience he had quite tired out, 
reproached him without mercy.&nbsp; Before he got there, it is 
related, that his very dog left him and departed from his side to
lick the hand of Henry.</p>
<p>The day before the Parliament met, a deputation went to this 
wrecked King, and told him that he had promised the Earl of 
Northumberland at Conway Castle to resign the crown.&nbsp; He 
said he was quite ready to do it, and signed a paper in which he 
renounced his authority and absolved his people from their 
allegiance to him.&nbsp; He had so little spirit left that he 
gave his royal ring to his triumphant cousin Henry with his own 
hand, and said, that if he could have had leave to appoint a 
successor, that same Henry was the man of all others whom he 
would have named.&nbsp; Next day, the Parliament assembled in 
Westminster Hall, where Henry sat at the side of the throne, 
which was empty and covered with a cloth of gold.&nbsp; The paper
just signed by the King was read to the multitude amid shouts of 
joy, which were echoed through all the streets; when some of the 
noise had died away, the King was formally deposed.&nbsp; Then 
Henry arose, and, making the sign of the cross on his forehead 
and breast, challenged the realm of England as his right; the 
archbishops of Canterbury and York seated him on the throne.</p>
<p>The multitude shouted again, and the shouts re-echoed 
throughout all the streets.&nbsp; No one remembered, now, that 
Richard the Second had ever been the most beautiful, the wisest, 
and the best of princes; and he now made living (to my thinking) 
a far more sorry spectacle in the Tower of London, than Wat Tyler
had made, lying dead, among the hoofs of the royal horses in 
Smithfield.</p>
<p>The Poll-tax died with Wat.&nbsp; The Smiths to the King and 
Royal Family, could make no chains in which the King could hang 
the people&rsquo;s recollection of him; so the Poll-tax was never
collected.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FOURTH, CALLED 
BOLINGBROKE</h2>
<p>During the last reign, the preaching of Wickliffe against the 
pride and cunning of the Pope and all his men, had made a great 
noise in England.&nbsp; Whether the new King wished to be in 
favour with the priests, or whether he hoped, by pretending to be
very religious, to cheat Heaven itself into the belief that he 
was not a usurper, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Both suppositions 
are likely enough.&nbsp; It is certain that he began his reign by
making a strong show against the followers of Wickliffe, who were
called Lollards, or heretics&mdash;although his father, John of 
Gaunt, had been of that way of thinking, as he himself had been 
more than suspected of being.&nbsp; It is no less certain that he
first established in England the detestable and atrocious custom,
brought from abroad, of burning those people as a punishment for 
their opinions.&nbsp; It was the importation into England of one 
of the practices of what was called the Holy Inquisition: which 
was the most <i>un</i>holy and the most infamous tribunal that 
ever disgraced mankind, and made men more like demons than 
followers of Our Saviour.</p>
<p>No real right to the crown, as you know, was in this 
King.&nbsp; Edward Mortimer, the young Earl of March&mdash;who 
was only eight or nine years old, and who was descended from the 
Duke of Clarence, the elder brother of Henry&rsquo;s 
father&mdash;was, by succession, the real heir to the 
throne.&nbsp; However, the King got his son declared Prince of 
Wales; and, obtaining possession of the young Earl of March and 
his little brother, kept them in confinement (but not severely) 
in Windsor Castle.&nbsp; He then required the Parliament to 
decide what was to be done with the deposed King, who was quiet 
enough, and who only said that he hoped his cousin Henry would be
&lsquo;a good lord&rsquo; to him.&nbsp; The Parliament replied 
that they would recommend his being kept in some secret place 
where the people could not resort, and where his friends could 
not be admitted to see him.&nbsp; Henry accordingly passed this 
sentence upon him, and it now began to be pretty clear to the 
nation that Richard the Second would not live very long.</p>
<p>It was a noisy Parliament, as it was an unprincipled one, and 
the Lords quarrelled so violently among themselves as to which of
them had been loyal and which disloyal, and which consistent and 
which inconsistent, that forty gauntlets are said to have been 
thrown upon the floor at one time as challenges to as many 
battles: the truth being that they were all false and base 
together, and had been, at one time with the old King, and at 
another time with the new one, and seldom true for any length of 
time to any one.&nbsp; They soon began to plot again.&nbsp; A 
conspiracy was formed to invite the King to a tournament at 
Oxford, and then to take him by surprise and kill him.&nbsp; This
murderous enterprise, which was agreed upon at secret meetings in
the house of the Abbot of Westminster, was betrayed by the Earl 
of Rutland&mdash;one of the conspirators.&nbsp; The King, instead
of going to the tournament or staying at Windsor (where the 
conspirators suddenly went, on finding themselves discovered, 
with the hope of seizing him), retired to London, proclaimed them
all traitors, and advanced upon them with a great force.&nbsp; 
They retired into the west of England, proclaiming Richard King; 
but, the people rose against them, and they were all slain.&nbsp;
Their treason hastened the death of the deposed monarch.&nbsp; 
Whether he was killed by hired assassins, or whether he was 
starved to death, or whether he refused food on hearing of his 
brothers being killed (who were in that plot), is very 
doubtful.&nbsp; He met his death somehow; and his body was 
publicly shown at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral with only the lower 
part of the face uncovered.&nbsp; I can scarcely doubt that he 
was killed by the King&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>The French wife of the miserable Richard was now only ten 
years old; and, when her father, Charles of France, heard of her 
misfortunes and of her lonely condition in England, he went mad: 
as he had several times done before, during the last five or six 
years.&nbsp; The French Dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon took up the
poor girl&rsquo;s cause, without caring much about it, but on the
chance of getting something out of England.&nbsp; The people of 
Bordeaux, who had a sort of superstitious attachment to the 
memory of Richard, because he was born there, swore by the Lord 
that he had been the best man in all his kingdom&mdash;which was 
going rather far&mdash;and promised to do great things against 
the English.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when they came to consider that 
they, and the whole people of France, were ruined by their own 
nobles, and that the English rule was much the better of the two,
they cooled down again; and the two dukes, although they were 
very great men, could do nothing without them.&nbsp; Then, began 
negotiations between France and England for the sending home to 
Paris of the poor little Queen with all her jewels and her 
fortune of two hundred thousand francs in gold.&nbsp; The King 
was quite willing to restore the young lady, and even the jewels;
but he said he really could not part with the money.&nbsp; So, at
last she was safely deposited at Paris without her fortune, and 
then the Duke of Burgundy (who was cousin to the French King) 
began to quarrel with the Duke of Orleans (who was brother to the
French King) about the whole matter; and those two dukes made 
France even more wretched than ever.</p>
<p>As the idea of conquering Scotland was still popular at home, 
the King marched to the river Tyne and demanded homage of the 
King of that country.&nbsp; This being refused, he advanced to 
Edinburgh, but did little there; for, his army being in want of 
provisions, and the Scotch being very careful to hold him in 
check without giving battle, he was obliged to retire.&nbsp; It 
is to his immortal honour that in this sally he burnt no villages
and slaughtered no people, but was particularly careful that his 
army should be merciful and harmless.&nbsp; It was a great 
example in those ruthless times.</p>
<p>A war among the border people of England and Scotland went on 
for twelve months, and then the Earl of Northumberland, the 
nobleman who had helped Henry to the crown, began to rebel 
against him&mdash;probably because nothing that Henry could do 
for him would satisfy his extravagant expectations.&nbsp; There 
was a certain Welsh gentleman, named <span class="smcap">Owen 
Glendower</span>, who had been a student in one of the Inns of 
Court, and had afterwards been in the service of the late King, 
whose Welsh property was taken from him by a powerful lord 
related to the present King, who was his neighbour.&nbsp; 
Appealing for redress, and getting none, he took up arms, was 
made an outlaw, and declared himself sovereign of Wales.&nbsp; He
pretended to be a magician; and not only were the Welsh people 
stupid enough to believe him, but, even Henry believed him too; 
for, making three expeditions into Wales, and being three times 
driven back by the wildness of the country, the bad weather, and 
the skill of Glendower, he thought he was defeated by the 
Welshman&rsquo;s magic arts.&nbsp; However, he took Lord Grey and
Sir Edmund Mortimer, prisoners, and allowed the relatives of Lord
Grey to ransom him, but would not extend such favour to Sir 
Edmund Mortimer.&nbsp; Now, Henry Percy, called <span 
class="smcap">Hotspur</span>, son of the Earl of Northumberland, 
who was married to Mortimer&rsquo;s sister, is supposed to have 
taken offence at this; and, therefore, in conjunction with his 
father and some others, to have joined Owen Glendower, and risen 
against Henry.&nbsp; It is by no means clear that this was the 
real cause of the conspiracy; but perhaps it was made the 
pretext.&nbsp; It was formed, and was very powerful; including 
<span class="smcap">Scroop</span>, Archbishop of York, and the 
<span class="smcap">Earl of Douglas</span>, a powerful and brave 
Scottish nobleman.&nbsp; The King was prompt and active, and the 
two armies met at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>There were about fourteen thousand men in each.&nbsp; The old 
Earl of Northumberland being sick, the rebel forces were led by 
his son.&nbsp; The King wore plain armour to deceive the enemy; 
and four noblemen, with the same object, wore the royal 
arms.&nbsp; The rebel charge was so furious, that every one of 
those gentlemen was killed, the royal standard was beaten down, 
and the young Prince of Wales was severely wounded in the 
face.&nbsp; But he was one of the bravest and best soldiers that 
ever lived, and he fought so well, and the King&rsquo;s troops 
were so encouraged by his bold example, that they rallied 
immediately, and cut the enemy&rsquo;s forces all to 
pieces.&nbsp; Hotspur was killed by an arrow in the brain, and 
the rout was so complete that the whole rebellion was struck down
by this one blow.&nbsp; The Earl of Northumberland surrendered 
himself soon after hearing of the death of his son, and received 
a pardon for all his offences.</p>
<p>There were some lingerings of rebellion yet: Owen Glendower 
being retired to Wales, and a preposterous story being spread 
among the ignorant people that King Richard was still 
alive.&nbsp; How they could have believed such nonsense it is 
difficult to imagine; but they certainly did suppose that the 
Court fool of the late King, who was something like him, was he, 
himself; so that it seemed as if, after giving so much trouble to
the country in his life, he was still to trouble it after his 
death.&nbsp; This was not the worst.&nbsp; The young Earl of 
March and his brother were stolen out of Windsor Castle.&nbsp; 
Being retaken, and being found to have been spirited away by one 
Lady Spencer, she accused her own brother, that Earl of Rutland 
who was in the former conspiracy and was now Duke of York, of 
being in the plot.&nbsp; For this he was ruined in fortune, 
though not put to death; and then another plot arose among the 
old Earl of Northumberland, some other lords, and that same 
Scroop, Archbishop of York, who was with the rebels before.&nbsp;
These conspirators caused a writing to be posted on the church 
doors, accusing the King of a variety of crimes; but, the King 
being eager and vigilant to oppose them, they were all taken, and
the Archbishop was executed.&nbsp; This was the first time that a
great churchman had been slain by the law in England; but the 
King was resolved that it should be done, and done it was.</p>
<p>The next most remarkable event of this time was the seizure, 
by Henry, of the heir to the Scottish throne&mdash;James, a boy 
of nine years old.&nbsp; He had been put aboard-ship by his 
father, the Scottish King Robert, to save him from the designs of
his uncle, when, on his way to France, he was accidentally taken 
by some English cruisers.&nbsp; He remained a prisoner in England
for nineteen years, and became in his prison a student and a 
famous poet.</p>
<p>With the exception of occasional troubles with the Welsh and 
with the French, the rest of King Henry&rsquo;s reign was quiet 
enough.&nbsp; But, the King was far from happy, and probably was 
troubled in his conscience by knowing that he had usurped the 
crown, and had occasioned the death of his miserable 
cousin.&nbsp; The Prince of Wales, though brave and generous, is 
said to have been wild and dissipated, and even to have drawn his
sword on <span class="smcap">Gascoigne</span>, the Chief Justice 
of the King&rsquo;s Bench, because he was firm in dealing 
impartially with one of his dissolute companions.&nbsp; Upon this
the Chief Justice is said to have ordered him immediately to 
prison; the Prince of Wales is said to have submitted with a good
grace; and the King is said to have exclaimed, &lsquo;Happy is 
the monarch who has so just a judge, and a son so willing to obey
the laws.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is all very doubtful, and so is 
another story (of which Shakespeare has made beautiful use), that
the Prince once took the crown out of his father&rsquo;s chamber 
as he was sleeping, and tried it on his own head.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s health sank more and more, and he became 
subject to violent eruptions on the face and to bad epileptic 
fits, and his spirits sank every day.&nbsp; At last, as he was 
praying before the shrine of St. Edward at Westminster Abbey, he 
was seized with a terrible fit, and was carried into the 
Abbot&rsquo;s chamber, where he presently died.&nbsp; It had been
foretold that he would die at Jerusalem, which certainly is not, 
and never was, Westminster.&nbsp; But, as the Abbot&rsquo;s room 
had long been called the Jerusalem chamber, people said it was 
all the same thing, and were quite satisfied with the 
prediction.</p>
<p>The King died on the 20th of March, 1413, in the forty-seventh
year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign.&nbsp; He was 
buried in Canterbury Cathedral.&nbsp; He had been twice married, 
and had, by his first wife, a family of four sons and two 
daughters.&nbsp; Considering his duplicity before he came to the 
throne, his unjust seizure of it, and above all, his making that 
monstrous law for the burning of what the priests called 
heretics, he was a reasonably good king, as kings went.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIFTH</h2>
<h3>FIRST PART</h3>
<p>The Prince of Wales began his reign like a generous and honest
man.&nbsp; He set the young Earl of March free; he restored their
estates and their honours to the Percy family, who had lost them 
by their rebellion against his father; he ordered the imbecile 
and unfortunate Richard to be honourably buried among the Kings 
of England; and he dismissed all his wild companions, with 
assurances that they should not want, if they would resolve to be
steady, faithful, and true.</p>
<p>It is much easier to burn men than to burn their opinions; and
those of the Lollards were spreading every day.&nbsp; The 
Lollards were represented by the priests&mdash;probably falsely 
for the most part&mdash;to entertain treasonable designs against 
the new King; and Henry, suffering himself to be worked upon by 
these representations, sacrificed his friend Sir John Oldcastle, 
the Lord Cobham, to them, after trying in vain to convert him by 
arguments.&nbsp; He was declared guilty, as the head of the sect,
and sentenced to the flames; but he escaped from the Tower before
the day of execution (postponed for fifty days by the King 
himself), and summoned the Lollards to meet him near London on a 
certain day.&nbsp; So the priests told the King, at least.&nbsp; 
I doubt whether there was any conspiracy beyond such as was got 
up by their agents.&nbsp; On the day appointed, instead of 
five-and-twenty thousand men, under the command of Sir John 
Oldcastle, in the meadows of St. Giles, the King found only 
eighty men, and no Sir John at all.&nbsp; There was, in another 
place, an addle-headed brewer, who had gold trappings to his 
horses, and a pair of gilt spurs in his breast&mdash;expecting to
be made a knight next day by Sir John, and so to gain the right 
to wear them&mdash;but there was no Sir John, nor did anybody 
give information respecting him, though the King offered great 
rewards for such intelligence.&nbsp; Thirty of these unfortunate 
Lollards were hanged and drawn immediately, and were then burnt, 
gallows and all; and the various prisons in and around London 
were crammed full of others.&nbsp; Some of these unfortunate men 
made various confessions of treasonable designs; but, such 
confessions were easily got, under torture and the fear of fire, 
and are very little to be trusted.&nbsp; To finish the sad story 
of Sir John Oldcastle at once, I may mention that he escaped into
Wales, and remained there safely, for four years.&nbsp; When 
discovered by Lord Powis, it is very doubtful if he would have 
been taken alive&mdash;so great was the old soldier&rsquo;s 
bravery&mdash;if a miserable old woman had not come behind him 
and broken his legs with a stool.&nbsp; He was carried to London 
in a horse-litter, was fastened by an iron chain to a gibbet, and
so roasted to death.</p>
<p>To make the state of France as plain as I can in a few words, 
I should tell you that the Duke of Orleans, and the Duke of 
Burgundy, commonly called &lsquo;John without fear,&rsquo; had 
had a grand reconciliation of their quarrel in the last reign, 
and had appeared to be quite in a heavenly state of mind.&nbsp; 
Immediately after which, on a Sunday, in the public streets of 
Paris, the Duke of Orleans was murdered by a party of twenty men,
set on by the Duke of Burgundy&mdash;according to his own 
deliberate confession.&nbsp; The widow of King Richard had been 
married in France to the eldest son of the Duke of Orleans.&nbsp;
The poor mad King was quite powerless to help her, and the Duke 
of Burgundy became the real master of France.&nbsp; Isabella 
dying, her husband (Duke of Orleans since the death of his 
father) married the daughter of the Count of Armagnac, who, being
a much abler man than his young son-in-law, headed his party; 
thence called after him Armagnacs.&nbsp; Thus, France was now in 
this terrible condition, that it had in it the party of the 
King&rsquo;s son, the Dauphin Louis; the party of the Duke of 
Burgundy, who was the father of the Dauphin&rsquo;s ill-used 
wife; and the party of the Armagnacs; all hating each other; all 
fighting together; all composed of the most depraved nobles that 
the earth has ever known; and all tearing unhappy France to 
pieces.</p>
<p>The late King had watched these dissensions from England, 
sensible (like the French people) that no enemy of France could 
injure her more than her own nobility.&nbsp; The present King now
advanced a claim to the French throne.&nbsp; His demand being, of
course, refused, he reduced his proposal to a certain large 
amount of French territory, and to demanding the French princess,
Catherine, in marriage, with a fortune of two millions of golden 
crowns.&nbsp; He was offered less territory and fewer crowns, and
no princess; but he called his ambassadors home and prepared for 
war.&nbsp; Then, he proposed to take the princess with one 
million of crowns.&nbsp; The French Court replied that he should 
have the princess with two hundred thousand crowns less; he said 
this would not do (he had never seen the princess in his life), 
and assembled his army at Southampton.&nbsp; There was a short 
plot at home just at that time, for deposing him, and making the 
Earl of March king; but the conspirators were all speedily 
condemned and executed, and the King embarked for France.</p>
<p>It is dreadful to observe how long a bad example will be 
followed; but, it is encouraging to know that a good example is 
never thrown away.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s first act on 
disembarking at the mouth of the river Seine, three miles from 
Harfleur, was to imitate his father, and to proclaim his solemn 
orders that the lives and property of the peaceable inhabitants 
should be respected on pain of death.&nbsp; It is agreed by 
French writers, to his lasting renown, that even while his 
soldiers were suffering the greatest distress from want of food, 
these commands were rigidly obeyed.</p>
<p>With an army in all of thirty thousand men, he besieged the 
town of Harfleur both by sea and land for five weeks; at the end 
of which time the town surrendered, and the inhabitants were 
allowed to depart with only fivepence each, and a part of their 
clothes.&nbsp; All the rest of their possessions was divided 
amongst the English army.&nbsp; But, that army suffered so much, 
in spite of its successes, from disease and privation, that it 
was already reduced one half.&nbsp; Still, the King was 
determined not to retire until he had struck a greater 
blow.&nbsp; Therefore, against the advice of all his counsellors,
he moved on with his little force towards Calais.&nbsp; When he 
came up to the river Somme he was unable to cross, in consequence
of the fort being fortified; and, as the English moved up the 
left bank of the river looking for a crossing, the French, who 
had broken all the bridges, moved up the right bank, watching 
them, and waiting to attack them when they should try to pass 
it.&nbsp; At last the English found a crossing and got safely 
over.&nbsp; The French held a council of war at Rouen, resolved 
to give the English battle, and sent heralds to King Henry to 
know by which road he was going.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the road that 
will take me straight to Calais!&rsquo; said the King, and sent 
them away with a present of a hundred crowns.</p>
<p>The English moved on, until they beheld the French, and then 
the King gave orders to form in line of battle.&nbsp; The French 
not coming on, the army broke up after remaining in battle array 
till night, and got good rest and refreshment at a neighbouring 
village.&nbsp; The French were now all lying in another village, 
through which they knew the English must pass.&nbsp; They were 
resolved that the English should begin the battle.&nbsp; The 
English had no means of retreat, if their King had any such 
intention; and so the two armies passed the night, close 
together.</p>
<p>To understand these armies well, you must bear in mind that 
the immense French army had, among its notable persons, almost 
the whole of that wicked nobility, whose debauchery had made 
France a desert; and so besotted were they by pride, and by 
contempt for the common people, that they had scarcely any bowmen
(if indeed they had any at all) in their whole enormous number: 
which, compared with the English army, was at least as six to 
one.&nbsp; For these proud fools had said that the bow was not a 
fit weapon for knightly hands, and that France must be defended 
by gentlemen only.&nbsp; We shall see, presently, what hand the 
gentlemen made of it.</p>
<p>Now, on the English side, among the little force, there was a 
good proportion of men who were not gentlemen by any means, but 
who were good stout archers for all that.&nbsp; Among them, in 
the morning&mdash;having slept little at night, while the French 
were carousing and making sure of victory&mdash;the King rode, on
a grey horse; wearing on his head a helmet of shining steel, 
surmounted by a crown of gold, sparkling with precious stones; 
and bearing over his armour, embroidered together, the arms of 
England and the arms of France.&nbsp; The archers looked at the 
shining helmet and the crown of gold and the sparkling jewels, 
and admired them all; but, what they admired most was the 
King&rsquo;s cheerful face, and his bright blue eye, as he told 
them that, for himself, he had made up his mind to conquer there 
or to die there, and that England should never have a ransom to 
pay for <i>him</i>.&nbsp; There was one brave knight who chanced 
to say that he wished some of the many gallant gentlemen and good
soldiers, who were then idle at home in England, were there to 
increase their numbers.&nbsp; But the King told him that, for his
part, he did not wish for one more man.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fewer we
have,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the greater will be the honour we 
shall win!&rsquo;&nbsp; His men, being now all in good heart, 
were refreshed with bread and wine, and heard prayers, and waited
quietly for the French.&nbsp; The King waited for the French, 
because they were drawn up thirty deep (the little English force 
was only three deep), on very difficult and heavy ground; and he 
knew that when they moved, there must be confusion among 
them.</p>
<p>As they did not move, he sent off two parties:&mdash;one to 
lie concealed in a wood on the left of the French: the other, to 
set fire to some houses behind the French after the battle should
be begun.&nbsp; This was scarcely done, when three of the proud 
French gentlemen, who were to defend their country without any 
help from the base peasants, came riding out, calling upon the 
English to surrender.&nbsp; The King warned those gentlemen 
himself to retire with all speed if they cared for their lives, 
and ordered the English banners to advance.&nbsp; Upon that, Sir 
Thomas Erpingham, a great English general, who commanded the 
archers, threw his truncheon into the air, joyfully, and all the 
English men, kneeling down upon the ground and biting it as if 
they took possession of the country, rose up with a great shout 
and fell upon the French.</p>
<p>Every archer was furnished with a great stake tipped with 
iron; and his orders were, to thrust this stake into the ground, 
to discharge his arrow, and then to fall back, when the French 
horsemen came on.&nbsp; As the haughty French gentlemen, who were
to break the English archers and utterly destroy them with their 
knightly lances, came riding up, they were received with such a 
blinding storm of arrows, that they broke and turned.&nbsp; 
Horses and men rolled over one another, and the confusion was 
terrific.&nbsp; Those who rallied and charged the archers got 
among the stakes on slippery and boggy ground, and were so 
bewildered that the English archers&mdash;who wore no armour, and
even took off their leathern coats to be more active&mdash;cut 
them to pieces, root and branch.&nbsp; Only three French horsemen
got within the stakes, and those were instantly despatched.&nbsp;
All this time the dense French army, being in armour, were 
sinking knee-deep into the mire; while the light English archers,
half-naked, were as fresh and active as if they were fighting on 
a marble floor.</p>
<p>But now, the second division of the French coming to the 
relief of the first, closed up in a firm mass; the English, 
headed by the King, attacked them; and the deadliest part of the 
battle began.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s brother, the Duke of 
Clarence, was struck down, and numbers of the French surrounded 
him; but, King Henry, standing over the body, fought like a lion 
until they were beaten off.</p>
<p>Presently, came up a band of eighteen French knights, bearing 
the banner of a certain French lord, who had sworn to kill or 
take the English King.&nbsp; One of them struck him such a blow 
with a battle-axe that he reeled and fell upon his knees; but, 
his faithful men, immediately closing round him, killed every one
of those eighteen knights, and so that French lord never kept his
oath.</p>
<p>The French Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, seeing this, made a 
desperate charge, and cut his way close up to the Royal Standard 
of England.&nbsp; He beat down the Duke of York, who was standing
near it; and, when the King came to his rescue, struck off a 
piece of the crown he wore.&nbsp; But, he never struck another 
blow in this world; for, even as he was in the act of saying who 
he was, and that he surrendered to the King; and even as the King
stretched out his hand to give him a safe and honourable 
acceptance of the offer; he fell dead, pierced by innumerable 
wounds.</p>
<p>The death of this nobleman decided the battle.&nbsp; The third
division of the French army, which had never struck a blow yet, 
and which was, in itself, more than double the whole English 
power, broke and fled.&nbsp; At this time of the fight, the 
English, who as yet had made no prisoners, began to take them in 
immense numbers, and were still occupied in doing so, or in 
killing those who would not surrender, when a great noise arose 
in the rear of the French&mdash;their flying banners were seen to
stop&mdash;and King Henry, supposing a great reinforcement to 
have arrived, gave orders that all the prisoners should be put to
death.&nbsp; As soon, however, as it was found that the noise was
only occasioned by a body of plundering peasants, the terrible 
massacre was stopped.</p>
<p>Then King Henry called to him the French herald, and asked him
to whom the victory belonged.</p>
<p>The herald replied, &lsquo;To the King of England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>We</i> have not made this havoc and 
slaughter,&rsquo; said the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the wrath of 
Heaven on the sins of France.&nbsp; What is the name of that 
castle yonder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The herald answered him, &lsquo;My lord, it is the castle of 
Azincourt.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the King, &lsquo;From henceforth 
this battle shall be known to posterity, by the name of the 
battle of Azincourt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our English historians have made it Agincourt; but, under that
name, it will ever be famous in English annals.</p>
<p>The loss upon the French side was enormous.&nbsp; Three Dukes 
were killed, two more were taken prisoners, seven Counts were 
killed, three more were taken prisoners, and ten thousand knights
and gentlemen were slain upon the field.&nbsp; The English loss 
amounted to sixteen hundred men, among whom were the Duke of York
and the Earl of Suffolk.</p>
<p>War is a dreadful thing; and it is appalling to know how the 
English were obliged, next morning, to kill those prisoners 
mortally wounded, who yet writhed in agony upon the ground; how 
the dead upon the French side were stripped by their own 
countrymen and countrywomen, and afterwards buried in great pits;
how the dead upon the English side were piled up in a great barn,
and how their bodies and the barn were all burned together.&nbsp;
It is in such things, and in many more much too horrible to 
relate, that the real desolation and wickedness of war 
consist.&nbsp; Nothing can make war otherwise than 
horrible.&nbsp; But the dark side of it was little thought of and
soon forgotten; and it cast no shade of trouble on the English 
people, except on those who had lost friends or relations in the 
fight.&nbsp; They welcomed their King home with shouts of 
rejoicing, and plunged into the water to bear him ashore on their
shoulders, and flocked out in crowds to welcome him in every town
through which he passed, and hung rich carpets and tapestries out
of the windows, and strewed the streets with flowers, and made 
the fountains run with wine, as the great field of Agincourt had 
run with blood.</p>
<h3>SECOND PART</h3>
<p>That proud and wicked French nobility who dragged their 
country to destruction, and who were every day and every year 
regarded with deeper hatred and detestation in the hearts of the 
French people, learnt nothing, even from the defeat of 
Agincourt.&nbsp; So far from uniting against the common enemy, 
they became, among themselves, more violent, more bloody, and 
more false&mdash;if that were possible&mdash;than they had been 
before.&nbsp; The Count of Armagnac persuaded the French king to 
plunder of her treasures Queen Isabella of Bavaria, and to make 
her a prisoner.&nbsp; She, who had hitherto been the bitter enemy
of the Duke of Burgundy, proposed to join him, in revenge.&nbsp; 
He carried her off to Troyes, where she proclaimed herself Regent
of France, and made him her lieutenant.&nbsp; The Armagnac party 
were at that time possessed of Paris; but, one of the gates of 
the city being secretly opened on a certain night to a party of 
the duke&rsquo;s men, they got into Paris, threw into the prisons
all the Armagnacs upon whom they could lay their hands, and, a 
few nights afterwards, with the aid of a furious mob of sixty 
thousand people, broke the prisons open, and killed them 
all.&nbsp; The former Dauphin was now dead, and the King&rsquo;s 
third son bore the title.&nbsp; Him, in the height of this 
murderous scene, a French knight hurried out of bed, wrapped in a
sheet, and bore away to Poitiers.&nbsp; So, when the revengeful 
Isabella and the Duke of Burgundy entered Paris in triumph after 
the slaughter of their enemies, the Dauphin was proclaimed at 
Poitiers as the real Regent.</p>
<p>King Henry had not been idle since his victory of Agincourt, 
but had repulsed a brave attempt of the French to recover 
Harfleur; had gradually conquered a great part of Normandy; and, 
at this crisis of affairs, took the important town of Rouen, 
after a siege of half a year.&nbsp; This great loss so alarmed 
the French, that the Duke of Burgundy proposed that a meeting to 
treat of peace should be held between the French and the English 
kings in a plain by the river Seine.&nbsp; On the appointed day, 
King Henry appeared there, with his two brothers, Clarence and 
Gloucester, and a thousand men.&nbsp; The unfortunate French 
King, being more mad than usual that day, could not come; but the
Queen came, and with her the Princess Catherine: who was a very 
lovely creature, and who made a real impression on King Henry, 
now that he saw her for the first time.&nbsp; This was the most 
important circumstance that arose out of the meeting.</p>
<p>As if it were impossible for a French nobleman of that time to
be true to his word of honour in anything, Henry discovered that 
the Duke of Burgundy was, at that very moment, in secret treaty 
with the Dauphin; and he therefore abandoned the negotiation.</p>
<p>The Duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin, each of whom with the 
best reason distrusted the other as a noble ruffian surrounded by
a party of noble ruffians, were rather at a loss how to proceed 
after this; but, at length they agreed to meet, on a bridge over 
the river Yonne, where it was arranged that there should be two 
strong gates put up, with an empty space between them; and that 
the Duke of Burgundy should come into that space by one gate, 
with ten men only; and that the Dauphin should come into that 
space by the other gate, also with ten men, and no more.</p>
<p>So far the Dauphin kept his word, but no farther.&nbsp; When 
the Duke of Burgundy was on his knee before him in the act of 
speaking, one of the Dauphin&rsquo;s noble ruffians cut the said 
duke down with a small axe, and others speedily finished him.</p>
<p>It was in vain for the Dauphin to pretend that this base 
murder was not done with his consent; it was too bad, even for 
France, and caused a general horror.&nbsp; The duke&rsquo;s heir 
hastened to make a treaty with King Henry, and the French Queen 
engaged that her husband should consent to it, whatever it 
was.&nbsp; Henry made peace, on condition of receiving the 
Princess Catherine in marriage, and being made Regent of France 
during the rest of the King&rsquo;s lifetime, and succeeding to 
the French crown at his death.&nbsp; He was soon married to the 
beautiful Princess, and took her proudly home to England, where 
she was crowned with great honour and glory.</p>
<p>This peace was called the Perpetual Peace; we shall soon see 
how long it lasted.&nbsp; It gave great satisfaction to the 
French people, although they were so poor and miserable, that, at
the time of the celebration of the Royal marriage, numbers of 
them were dying with starvation, on the dunghills in the streets 
of Paris.&nbsp; There was some resistance on the part of the 
Dauphin in some few parts of France, but King Henry beat it all 
down.</p>
<p>And now, with his great possessions in France secured, and his
beautiful wife to cheer him, and a son born to give him greater 
happiness, all appeared bright before him.&nbsp; But, in the 
fulness of his triumph and the height of his power, Death came 
upon him, and his day was done.&nbsp; When he fell ill at 
Vincennes, and found that he could not recover, he was very calm 
and quiet, and spoke serenely to those who wept around his 
bed.&nbsp; His wife and child, he said, he left to the loving 
care of his brother the Duke of Bedford, and his other faithful 
nobles.&nbsp; He gave them his advice that England should 
establish a friendship with the new Duke of Burgundy, and offer 
him the regency of France; that it should not set free the royal 
princes who had been taken at Agincourt; and that, whatever 
quarrel might arise with France, England should never make peace 
without holding Normandy.&nbsp; Then, he laid down his head, and 
asked the attendant priests to chant the penitential 
psalms.&nbsp; Amid which solemn sounds, on the thirty-first of 
August, one thousand four hundred and twenty-two, in only the 
thirty-fourth year of his age and the tenth of his reign, King 
Henry the Fifth passed away.</p>
<p>Slowly and mournfully they carried his embalmed body in a 
procession of great state to Paris, and thence to Rouen where his
Queen was: from whom the sad intelligence of his death was 
concealed until he had been dead some days.&nbsp; Thence, lying 
on a bed of crimson and gold, with a golden crown upon the head, 
and a golden ball and sceptre lying in the nerveless hands, they 
carried it to Calais, with such a great retinue as seemed to dye 
the road black.&nbsp; The King of Scotland acted as chief 
mourner, all the Royal Household followed, the knights wore black
armour and black plumes of feathers, crowds of men bore torches, 
making the night as light as day; and the widowed Princess 
followed last of all.&nbsp; At Calais there was a fleet of ships 
to bring the funeral host to Dover.&nbsp; And so, by way of 
London Bridge, where the service for the dead was chanted as it 
passed along, they brought the body to Westminster Abbey, and 
there buried it with great respect.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SIXTH</h2>
<h3>PART THE FIRST</h3>
<p>It had been the wish of the late King, that while his infant 
son <span class="smcap">King Henry the Sixth</span>, at this time
only nine months old, was under age, the Duke of Gloucester 
should be appointed Regent.&nbsp; The English Parliament, 
however, preferred to appoint a Council of Regency, with the Duke
of Bedford at its head: to be represented, in his absence only, 
by the Duke of Gloucester.&nbsp; The Parliament would seem to 
have been wise in this, for Gloucester soon showed himself to be 
ambitious and troublesome, and, in the gratification of his own 
personal schemes, gave dangerous offence to the Duke of Burgundy,
which was with difficulty adjusted.</p>
<p>As that duke declined the Regency of France, it was bestowed 
by the poor French King upon the Duke of Bedford.&nbsp; But, the 
French King dying within two months, the Dauphin instantly 
asserted his claim to the French throne, and was actually crowned
under the title of <span class="smcap">Charles the 
Seventh</span>.&nbsp; The Duke of Bedford, to be a match for him,
entered into a friendly league with the Dukes of Burgundy and 
Brittany, and gave them his two sisters in marriage.&nbsp; War 
with France was immediately renewed, and the Perpetual Peace came
to an untimely end.</p>
<p>In the first campaign, the English, aided by this alliance, 
were speedily successful.&nbsp; As Scotland, however, had sent 
the French five thousand men, and might send more, or attack the 
North of England while England was busy with France, it was 
considered that it would be a good thing to offer the Scottish 
King, James, who had been so long imprisoned, his liberty, on his
paying forty thousand pounds for his board and lodging during 
nineteen years, and engaging to forbid his subjects from serving 
under the flag of France.&nbsp; It is pleasant to know, not only 
that the amiable captive at last regained his freedom upon these 
terms, but, that he married a noble English lady, with whom he 
had been long in love, and became an excellent King.&nbsp; I am 
afraid we have met with some Kings in this history, and shall 
meet with some more, who would have been very much the better, 
and would have left the world much happier, if they had been 
imprisoned nineteen years too.</p>
<p>In the second campaign, the English gained a considerable 
victory at Verneuil, in a battle which was chiefly remarkable, 
otherwise, for their resorting to the odd expedient of tying 
their baggage-horses together by the heads and tails, and 
jumbling them up with the baggage, so as to convert them into a 
sort of live fortification&mdash;which was found useful to the 
troops, but which I should think was not agreeable to the 
horses.&nbsp; For three years afterwards very little was done, 
owing to both sides being too poor for war, which is a very 
expensive entertainment; but, a council was then held in Paris, 
in which it was decided to lay siege to the town of Orleans, 
which was a place of great importance to the Dauphin&rsquo;s 
cause.&nbsp; An English army of ten thousand men was despatched 
on this service, under the command of the Earl of Salisbury, a 
general of fame.&nbsp; He being unfortunately killed early in the
siege, the Earl of Suffolk took his place; under whom (reinforced
by <span class="smcap">Sir John Falstaff</span>, who brought up 
four hundred waggons laden with salt herrings and other 
provisions for the troops, and, beating off the French who tried 
to intercept him, came victorious out of a hot skirmish, which 
was afterwards called in jest the Battle of the Herrings) the 
town of Orleans was so completely hemmed in, that the besieged 
proposed to yield it up to their countryman the Duke of 
Burgundy.&nbsp; The English general, however, replied that his 
English men had won it, so far, by their blood and valour, and 
that his English men must have it.&nbsp; There seemed to be no 
hope for the town, or for the Dauphin, who was so dismayed that 
he even thought of flying to Scotland or to Spain&mdash;when a 
peasant girl rose up and changed the whole state of affairs.</p>
<p>The story of this peasant girl I have now to tell.</p>
<h3>PART THE SECOND: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC</h3>
<p>In a remote village among some wild hills in the province of 
Lorraine, there lived a countryman whose name was <span 
class="smcap">Jacques d&rsquo;Arc</span>.&nbsp; He had a 
daughter, <span class="smcap">Joan of Arc</span>, who was at this
time in her twentieth year.&nbsp; She had been a solitary girl 
from her childhood; she had often tended sheep and cattle for 
whole days where no human figure was seen or human voice heard; 
and she had often knelt, for hours together, in the gloomy, 
empty, little village chapel, looking up at the altar and at the 
dim lamp burning before it, until she fancied that she saw 
shadowy figures standing there, and even that she heard them 
speak to her.&nbsp; The people in that part of France were very 
ignorant and superstitious, and they had many ghostly tales to 
tell about what they had dreamed, and what they saw among the 
lonely hills when the clouds and the mists were resting on 
them.&nbsp; So, they easily believed that Joan saw strange 
sights, and they whispered among themselves that angels and 
spirits talked to her.</p>
<p>At last, Joan told her father that she had one day been 
surprised by a great unearthly light, and had afterwards heard a 
solemn voice, which said it was Saint Michael&rsquo;s voice, 
telling her that she was to go and help the Dauphin.&nbsp; Soon 
after this (she said), Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret had 
appeared to her with sparkling crowns upon their heads, and had 
encouraged her to be virtuous and resolute.&nbsp; These visions 
had returned sometimes; but the Voices very often; and the voices
always said, &lsquo;Joan, thou art appointed by Heaven to go and 
help the Dauphin!&rsquo;&nbsp; She almost always heard them while
the chapel bells were ringing.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, now, that Joan believed she saw and heard 
these things.&nbsp; It is very well known that such delusions are
a disease which is not by any means uncommon.&nbsp; It is 
probable enough that there were figures of Saint Michael, and 
Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, in the little chapel (where 
they would be very likely to have shining crowns upon their 
heads), and that they first gave Joan the idea of those three 
personages.&nbsp; She had long been a moping, fanciful girl, and,
though she was a very good girl, I dare say she was a little 
vain, and wishful for notoriety.</p>
<p>Her father, something wiser than his neighbours, said, 
&lsquo;I tell thee, Joan, it is thy fancy.&nbsp; Thou hadst 
better have a kind husband to take care of thee, girl, and work 
to employ thy mind!&rsquo;&nbsp; But Joan told him in reply, that
she had taken a vow never to have a husband, and that she must go
as Heaven directed her, to help the Dauphin.</p>
<p>It happened, unfortunately for her father&rsquo;s persuasions,
and most unfortunately for the poor girl, too, that a party of 
the Dauphin&rsquo;s enemies found their way into the village 
while Joan&rsquo;s disorder was at this point, and burnt the 
chapel, and drove out the inhabitants.&nbsp; The cruelties she 
saw committed, touched Joan&rsquo;s heart and made her 
worse.&nbsp; She said that the voices and the figures were now 
continually with her; that they told her she was the girl who, 
according to an old prophecy, was to deliver France; and she must
go and help the Dauphin, and must remain with him until he should
be crowned at Rheims: and that she must travel a long way to a 
certain lord named <span class="smcap">Baudricourt</span>, who 
could and would, bring her into the Dauphin&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>As her father still said, &lsquo;I tell thee, Joan, it is thy 
fancy,&rsquo; she set off to find out this lord, accompanied by 
an uncle, a poor village wheelwright and cart-maker, who believed
in the reality of her visions.&nbsp; They travelled a long way 
and went on and on, over a rough country, full of the Duke of 
Burgundy&rsquo;s men, and of all kinds of robbers and marauders, 
until they came to where this lord was.</p>
<p>When his servants told him that there was a poor peasant girl 
named Joan of Arc, accompanied by nobody but an old village 
wheelwright and cart-maker, who wished to see him because she was
commanded to help the Dauphin and save France, Baudricourt burst 
out a-laughing, and bade them send the girl away.&nbsp; But, he 
soon heard so much about her lingering in the town, and praying 
in the churches, and seeing visions, and doing harm to no one, 
that he sent for her, and questioned her.&nbsp; As she said the 
same things after she had been well sprinkled with holy water as 
she had said before the sprinkling, Baudricourt began to think 
there might be something in it.&nbsp; At all events, he thought 
it worth while to send her on to the town of Chinon, where the 
Dauphin was.&nbsp; So, he bought her a horse, and a sword, and 
gave her two squires to conduct her.&nbsp; As the Voices had told
Joan that she was to wear a man&rsquo;s dress, now, she put one 
on, and girded her sword to her side, and bound spurs to her 
heels, and mounted her horse and rode away with her two 
squires.&nbsp; As to her uncle the wheelwright, he stood staring 
at his niece in wonder until she was out of sight&mdash;as well 
he might&mdash;and then went home again.&nbsp; The best place, 
too.</p>
<p>Joan and her two squires rode on and on, until they came to 
Chinon, where she was, after some doubt, admitted into the 
Dauphin&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; Picking him out immediately from 
all his court, she told him that she came commanded by Heaven to 
subdue his enemies and conduct him to his coronation at 
Rheims.&nbsp; She also told him (or he pretended so afterwards, 
to make the greater impression upon his soldiers) a number of his
secrets known only to himself, and, furthermore, she said there 
was an old, old sword in the cathedral of Saint Catherine at 
Fierbois, marked with five old crosses on the blade, which Saint 
Catherine had ordered her to wear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p158b.jpg">
<img alt="Joan of Arc" src="images/p158s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Now, nobody knew anything about this old, old sword, but when 
the cathedral came to be examined&mdash;which was immediately 
done&mdash;there, sure enough, the sword was found!&nbsp; The 
Dauphin then required a number of grave priests and bishops to 
give him their opinion whether the girl derived her power from 
good spirits or from evil spirits, which they held prodigiously 
long debates about, in the course of which several learned men 
fell fast asleep and snored loudly.&nbsp; At last, when one gruff
old gentleman had said to Joan, &lsquo;What language do your 
Voices speak?&rsquo; and when Joan had replied to the gruff old 
gentleman, &lsquo;A pleasanter language than yours,&rsquo; they 
agreed that it was all correct, and that Joan of Arc was inspired
from Heaven.&nbsp; This wonderful circumstance put new heart into
the Dauphin&rsquo;s soldiers when they heard of it, and 
dispirited the English army, who took Joan for a witch.</p>
<p>So Joan mounted horse again, and again rode on and on, until 
she came to Orleans.&nbsp; But she rode now, as never peasant 
girl had ridden yet.&nbsp; She rode upon a white war-horse, in a 
suit of glittering armour; with the old, old sword from the 
cathedral, newly burnished, in her belt; with a white flag 
carried before her, upon which were a picture of God, and the 
words <span class="smcap">Jesus Maria</span>.&nbsp; In this 
splendid state, at the head of a great body of troops escorting 
provisions of all kinds for the starving inhabitants of Orleans, 
she appeared before that beleaguered city.</p>
<p>When the people on the walls beheld her, they cried out 
&lsquo;The Maid is come!&nbsp; The Maid of the Prophecy is come 
to deliver us!&rsquo;&nbsp; And this, and the sight of the Maid 
fighting at the head of their men, made the French so bold, and 
made the English so fearful, that the English line of forts was 
soon broken, the troops and provisions were got into the town, 
and Orleans was saved.</p>
<p>Joan, henceforth called <span class="smcap">The Maid of 
Orleans</span>, remained within the walls for a few days, and 
caused letters to be thrown over, ordering Lord Suffolk and his 
Englishmen to depart from before the town according to the will 
of Heaven.&nbsp; As the English general very positively declined 
to believe that Joan knew anything about the will of Heaven 
(which did not mend the matter with his soldiers, for they 
stupidly said if she were not inspired she was a witch, and it 
was of no use to fight against a witch), she mounted her white 
war-horse again, and ordered her white banner to advance.</p>
<p>The besiegers held the bridge, and some strong towers upon the
bridge; and here the Maid of Orleans attacked them.&nbsp; The 
fight was fourteen hours long.&nbsp; She planted a scaling ladder
with her own hands, and mounted a tower wall, but was struck by 
an English arrow in the neck, and fell into the trench.&nbsp; She
was carried away and the arrow was taken out, during which 
operation she screamed and cried with the pain, as any other girl
might have done; but presently she said that the Voices were 
speaking to her and soothing her to rest.&nbsp; After a while, 
she got up, and was again foremost in the fight.&nbsp; When the 
English who had seen her fall and supposed her dead, saw this, 
they were troubled with the strangest fears, and some of them 
cried out that they beheld Saint Michael on a white horse 
(probably Joan herself) fighting for the French.&nbsp; They lost 
the bridge, and lost the towers, and next day set their chain of 
forts on fire, and left the place.</p>
<p>But as Lord Suffolk himself retired no farther than the town 
of Jargeau, which was only a few miles off, the Maid of Orleans 
besieged him there, and he was taken prisoner.&nbsp; As the white
banner scaled the wall, she was struck upon the head with a 
stone, and was again tumbled down into the ditch; but, she only 
cried all the more, as she lay there, &lsquo;On, on, my 
countrymen!&nbsp; And fear nothing, for the Lord hath delivered 
them into our hands!&rsquo;&nbsp; After this new success of the 
Maid&rsquo;s, several other fortresses and places which had 
previously held out against the Dauphin were delivered up without
a battle; and at Patay she defeated the remainder of the English 
army, and set up her victorious white banner on a field where 
twelve hundred Englishmen lay dead.</p>
<p>She now urged the Dauphin (who always kept out of the way when
there was any fighting) to proceed to Rheims, as the first part 
of her mission was accomplished; and to complete the whole by 
being crowned there.&nbsp; The Dauphin was in no particular hurry
to do this, as Rheims was a long way off, and the English and the
Duke of Burgundy were still strong in the country through which 
the road lay.&nbsp; However, they set forth, with ten thousand 
men, and again the Maid of Orleans rode on and on, upon her white
war-horse, and in her shining armour.&nbsp; Whenever they came to
a town which yielded readily, the soldiers believed in her; but, 
whenever they came to a town which gave them any trouble, they 
began to murmur that she was an impostor.&nbsp; The latter was 
particularly the case at Troyes, which finally yielded, however, 
through the persuasion of one Richard, a friar of the 
place.&nbsp; Friar Richard was in the old doubt about the Maid of
Orleans, until he had sprinkled her well with holy water, and had
also well sprinkled the threshold of the gate by which she came 
into the city.&nbsp; Finding that it made no change in her or the
gate, he said, as the other grave old gentlemen had said, that it
was all right, and became her great ally.</p>
<p>So, at last, by dint of riding on and on, the Maid of Orleans,
and the Dauphin, and the ten thousand sometimes believing and 
sometimes unbelieving men, came to Rheims.&nbsp; And in the great
cathedral of Rheims, the Dauphin actually was crowned Charles the
Seventh in a great assembly of the people.&nbsp; Then, the Maid, 
who with her white banner stood beside the King in that hour of 
his triumph, kneeled down upon the pavement at his feet, and 
said, with tears, that what she had been inspired to do, was 
done, and that the only recompense she asked for, was, that she 
should now have leave to go back to her distant home, and her 
sturdily incredulous father, and her first simple escort the 
village wheelwright and cart-maker.&nbsp; But the King said 
&lsquo;No!&rsquo; and made her and her family as noble as a King 
could, and settled upon her the income of a Count.</p>
<p>Ah! happy had it been for the Maid of Orleans, if she had 
resumed her rustic dress that day, and had gone home to the 
little chapel and the wild hills, and had forgotten all these 
things, and had been a good man&rsquo;s wife, and had heard no 
stranger voices than the voices of little children!</p>
<p>It was not to be, and she continued helping the King (she did 
a world for him, in alliance with Friar Richard), and trying to 
improve the lives of the coarse soldiers, and leading a 
religious, an unselfish, and a modest life, herself, beyond any 
doubt.&nbsp; Still, many times she prayed the King to let her go 
home; and once she even took off her bright armour and hung it up
in a church, meaning never to wear it more.&nbsp; But, the King 
always won her back again&mdash;while she was of any use to 
him&mdash;and so she went on and on and on, to her doom.</p>
<p>When the Duke of Bedford, who was a very able man, began to be
active for England, and, by bringing the war back into France and
by holding the Duke of Burgundy to his faith, to distress and 
disturb Charles very much, Charles sometimes asked the Maid of 
Orleans what the Voices said about it?&nbsp; But, the Voices had 
become (very like ordinary voices in perplexed times) 
contradictory and confused, so that now they said one thing, and 
now said another, and the Maid lost credit every day.&nbsp; 
Charles marched on Paris, which was opposed to him, and attacked 
the suburb of Saint Honor&eacute;.&nbsp; In this fight, being 
again struck down into the ditch, she was abandoned by the whole 
army.&nbsp; She lay unaided among a heap of dead, and crawled out
how she could.&nbsp; Then, some of her believers went over to an 
opposition Maid, Catherine of La Rochelle, who said she was 
inspired to tell where there were treasures of buried 
money&mdash;though she never did&mdash;and then Joan accidentally
broke the old, old sword, and others said that her power was 
broken with it.&nbsp; Finally, at the siege of Compi&egrave;gne, 
held by the Duke of Burgundy, where she did valiant service, she 
was basely left alone in a retreat, though facing about and 
fighting to the last; and an archer pulled her off her horse.</p>
<p>O the uproar that was made, and the thanksgivings that were 
sung, about the capture of this one poor country-girl!&nbsp; O 
the way in which she was demanded to be tried for sorcery and 
heresy, and anything else you like, by the Inquisitor-General of 
France, and by this great man, and by that great man, until it is
wearisome to think of! She was bought at last by the Bishop of 
Beauvais for ten thousand francs, and was shut up in her narrow 
prison: plain Joan of Arc again, and Maid of Orleans no more.</p>
<p>I should never have done if I were to tell you how they had 
Joan out to examine her, and cross-examine her, and re-examine 
her, and worry her into saying anything and everything; and how 
all sorts of scholars and doctors bestowed their utmost 
tediousness upon her.&nbsp; Sixteen times she was brought out and
shut up again, and worried, and entrapped, and argued with, until
she was heart-sick of the dreary business.&nbsp; On the last 
occasion of this kind she was brought into a burial-place at 
Rouen, dismally decorated with a scaffold, and a stake and 
faggots, and the executioner, and a pulpit with a friar therein, 
and an awful sermon ready.&nbsp; It is very affecting to know 
that even at that pass the poor girl honoured the mean vermin of 
a King, who had so used her for his purposes and so abandoned 
her; and, that while she had been regardless of reproaches heaped
upon herself, she spoke out courageously for him.</p>
<p>It was natural in one so young to hold to life.&nbsp; To save 
her life, she signed a declaration prepared for her&mdash;signed 
it with a cross, for she couldn&rsquo;t write&mdash;that all her 
visions and Voices had come from the Devil.&nbsp; Upon her 
recanting the past, and protesting that she would never wear a 
man&rsquo;s dress in future, she was condemned to imprisonment 
for life, &lsquo;on the bread of sorrow and the water of 
affliction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction, the 
visions and the Voices soon returned.&nbsp; It was quite natural 
that they should do so, for that kind of disease is much 
aggravated by fasting, loneliness, and anxiety of mind.&nbsp; It 
was not only got out of Joan that she considered herself inspired
again, but, she was taken in a man&rsquo;s dress, which had been 
left&mdash;to entrap her&mdash;in her prison, and which she put 
on, in her solitude; perhaps, in remembrance of her past glories,
perhaps, because the imaginary Voices told her.&nbsp; For this 
relapse into the sorcery and heresy and anything else you like, 
she was sentenced to be burnt to death.&nbsp; And, in the 
market-place of Rouen, in the hideous dress which the monks had 
invented for such spectacles; with priests and bishops sitting in
a gallery looking on, though some had the Christian grace to go 
away, unable to endure the infamous scene; this shrieking 
girl&mdash;last seen amidst the smoke and fire, holding a 
crucifix between her hands; last heard, calling upon 
Christ&mdash;was burnt to ashes.&nbsp; They threw her ashes into 
the river Seine; but they will rise against her murderers on the 
last day.</p>
<p>From the moment of her capture, neither the French King nor 
one single man in all his court raised a finger to save 
her.&nbsp; It is no defence of them that they may have never 
really believed in her, or that they may have won her victories 
by their skill and bravery.&nbsp; The more they pretended to 
believe in her, the more they had caused her to believe in 
herself; and she had ever been true to them, ever brave, ever 
nobly devoted.&nbsp; But, it is no wonder, that they, who were in
all things false to themselves, false to one another, false to 
their country, false to Heaven, false to Earth, should be 
monsters of ingratitude and treachery to a helpless peasant 
girl.</p>
<p>In the picturesque old town of Rouen, where weeds and grass 
grow high on the cathedral towers, and the venerable Norman 
streets are still warm in the blessed sunlight though the monkish
fires that once gleamed horribly upon them have long grown cold, 
there is a statue of Joan of Arc, in the scene of her last agony,
the square to which she has given its present name.&nbsp; I know 
some statues of modern times&mdash;even in the World&rsquo;s 
metropolis, I think&mdash;which commemorate less constancy, less 
earnestness, smaller claims upon the world&rsquo;s attention, and
much greater impostors.</p>
<h3>PART THE THIRD</h3>
<p>Bad deeds seldom prosper, happily for mankind; and the English
cause gained no advantage from the cruel death of Joan of 
Arc.&nbsp; For a long time, the war went heavily on.&nbsp; The 
Duke of Bedford died; the alliance with the Duke of Burgundy was 
broken; and Lord Talbot became a great general on the English 
side in France.&nbsp; But, two of the consequences of wars are, 
Famine&mdash;because the people cannot peacefully cultivate the 
ground&mdash;and Pestilence, which comes of want, misery, and 
suffering.&nbsp; Both these horrors broke out in both countries, 
and lasted for two wretched years.&nbsp; Then, the war went on 
again, and came by slow degrees to be so badly conducted by the 
English government, that, within twenty years from the execution 
of the Maid of Orleans, of all the great French conquests, the 
town of Calais alone remained in English hands.</p>
<p>While these victories and defeats were taking place in the 
course of time, many strange things happened at home.&nbsp; The 
young King, as he grew up, proved to be very unlike his great 
father, and showed himself a miserable puny creature.&nbsp; There
was no harm in him&mdash;he had a great aversion to shedding 
blood: which was something&mdash;but, he was a weak, silly, 
helpless young man, and a mere shuttlecock to the great lordly 
battledores about the Court.</p>
<p>Of these battledores, Cardinal Beaufort, a relation of the 
King, and the Duke of Gloucester, were at first the most 
powerful.&nbsp; The Duke of Gloucester had a wife, who was 
nonsensically accused of practising witchcraft to cause the 
King&rsquo;s death and lead to her husband&rsquo;s coming to the 
throne, he being the next heir.&nbsp; She was charged with 
having, by the help of a ridiculous old woman named Margery (who 
was called a witch), made a little waxen doll in the King&rsquo;s
likeness, and put it before a slow fire that it might gradually 
melt away.&nbsp; It was supposed, in such cases, that the death 
of the person whom the doll was made to represent, was sure to 
happen.&nbsp; Whether the duchess was as ignorant as the rest of 
them, and really did make such a doll with such an intention, I 
don&rsquo;t know; but, you and I know very well that she might 
have made a thousand dolls, if she had been stupid enough, and 
might have melted them all, without hurting the King or anybody 
else.&nbsp; However, she was tried for it, and so was old 
Margery, and so was one of the duke&rsquo;s chaplains, who was 
charged with having assisted them.&nbsp; Both he and Margery were
put to death, and the duchess, after being taken on foot and 
bearing a lighted candle, three times round the City, as a 
penance, was imprisoned for life.&nbsp; The duke, himself, took 
all this pretty quietly, and made as little stir about the matter
as if he were rather glad to be rid of the duchess.</p>
<p>But, he was not destined to keep himself out of trouble 
long.&nbsp; The royal shuttlecock being three-and-twenty, the 
battledores were very anxious to get him married.&nbsp; The Duke 
of Gloucester wanted him to marry a daughter of the Count of 
Armagnac; but, the Cardinal and the Earl of Suffolk were all for 
<span class="smcap">Margaret</span>, the daughter of the King of 
Sicily, who they knew was a resolute, ambitious woman and would 
govern the King as she chose.&nbsp; To make friends with this 
lady, the Earl of Suffolk, who went over to arrange the match, 
consented to accept her for the King&rsquo;s wife without any 
fortune, and even to give up the two most valuable possessions 
England then had in France.&nbsp; So, the marriage was arranged, 
on terms very advantageous to the lady; and Lord Suffolk brought 
her to England, and she was married at Westminster.&nbsp; On what
pretence this queen and her party charged the Duke of Gloucester 
with high treason within a couple of years, it is impossible to 
make out, the matter is so confused; but, they pretended that the
King&rsquo;s life was in danger, and they took the duke 
prisoner.&nbsp; A fortnight afterwards, he was found dead in bed 
(they said), and his body was shown to the people, and Lord 
Suffolk came in for the best part of his estates.&nbsp; You know 
by this time how strangely liable state prisoners were to sudden 
death.</p>
<p>If Cardinal Beaufort had any hand in this matter, it did him 
no good, for he died within six weeks; thinking it very hard and 
curious&mdash;at eighty years old!&mdash;that he could not live 
to be Pope.</p>
<p>This was the time when England had completed her loss of all 
her great French conquests.&nbsp; The people charged the loss 
principally upon the Earl of Suffolk, now a duke, who had made 
those easy terms about the Royal Marriage, and who, they 
believed, had even been bought by France.&nbsp; So he was 
impeached as a traitor, on a great number of charges, but chiefly
on accusations of having aided the French King, and of designing 
to make his own son King of England.&nbsp; The Commons and the 
people being violent against him, the King was made (by his 
friends) to interpose to save him, by banishing him for five 
years, and proroguing the Parliament.&nbsp; The duke had much ado
to escape from a London mob, two thousand strong, who lay in wait
for him in St. Giles&rsquo;s fields; but, he got down to his own 
estates in Suffolk, and sailed away from Ipswich.&nbsp; Sailing 
across the Channel, he sent into Calais to know if he might land 
there; but, they kept his boat and men in the harbour, until an 
English ship, carrying a hundred and fifty men and called the 
Nicholas of the Tower, came alongside his little vessel, and 
ordered him on board.&nbsp; &lsquo;Welcome, traitor, as men 
say,&rsquo; was the captain&rsquo;s grim and not very respectful 
salutation.&nbsp; He was kept on board, a prisoner, for 
eight-and-forty hours, and then a small boat appeared rowing 
toward the ship.&nbsp; As this boat came nearer, it was seen to 
have in it a block, a rusty sword, and an executioner in a black 
mask.&nbsp; The duke was handed down into it, and there his head 
was cut off with six strokes of the rusty sword.&nbsp; Then, the 
little boat rowed away to Dover beach, where the body was cast 
out, and left until the duchess claimed it.&nbsp; By whom, high 
in authority, this murder was committed, has never 
appeared.&nbsp; No one was ever punished for it.</p>
<p>There now arose in Kent an Irishman, who gave himself the name
of Mortimer, but whose real name was <span class="smcap">Jack 
Cade</span>.&nbsp; Jack, in imitation of Wat Tyler, though he was
a very different and inferior sort of man, addressed the Kentish 
men upon their wrongs, occasioned by the bad government of 
England, among so many battledores and such a poor shuttlecock; 
and the Kentish men rose up to the number of twenty 
thousand.&nbsp; Their place of assembly was Blackheath, where, 
headed by Jack, they put forth two papers, which they called 
&lsquo;The Complaint of the Commons of Kent,&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;The Requests of the Captain of the Great Assembly in 
Kent.&rsquo;&nbsp; They then retired to Sevenoaks.&nbsp; The 
royal army coming up with them here, they beat it and killed 
their general.&nbsp; Then, Jack dressed himself in the dead 
general&rsquo;s armour, and led his men to London.</p>
<p>Jack passed into the City from Southwark, over the bridge, and
entered it in triumph, giving the strictest orders to his men not
to plunder.&nbsp; Having made a show of his forces there, while 
the citizens looked on quietly, he went back into Southwark in 
good order, and passed the night.&nbsp; Next day, he came back 
again, having got hold in the meantime of Lord Say, an unpopular 
nobleman.&nbsp; Says Jack to the Lord Mayor and judges: 
&lsquo;Will you be so good as to make a tribunal in Guildhall, 
and try me this nobleman?&rsquo;&nbsp; The court being hastily 
made, he was found guilty, and Jack and his men cut his head off 
on Cornhill.&nbsp; They also cut off the head of his son-in-law, 
and then went back in good order to Southwark again.</p>
<p>But, although the citizens could bear the beheading of an 
unpopular lord, they could not bear to have their houses 
pillaged.&nbsp; And it did so happen that Jack, after 
dinner&mdash;perhaps he had drunk a little too much&mdash;began 
to plunder the house where he lodged; upon which, of course, his 
men began to imitate him.&nbsp; Wherefore, the Londoners took 
counsel with Lord Scales, who had a thousand soldiers in the 
Tower; and defended London Bridge, and kept Jack and his people 
out.&nbsp; This advantage gained, it was resolved by divers great
men to divide Jack&rsquo;s army in the old way, by making a great
many promises on behalf of the state, that were never intended to
be performed.&nbsp; This <i>did</i> divide them; some of 
Jack&rsquo;s men saying that they ought to take the conditions 
which were offered, and others saying that they ought not, for 
they were only a snare; some going home at once; others staying 
where they were; and all doubting and quarrelling among 
themselves.</p>
<p>Jack, who was in two minds about fighting or accepting a 
pardon, and who indeed did both, saw at last that there was 
nothing to expect from his men, and that it was very likely some 
of them would deliver him up and get a reward of a thousand 
marks, which was offered for his apprehension.&nbsp; So, after 
they had travelled and quarrelled all the way from Southwark to 
Blackheath, and from Blackheath to Rochester, he mounted a good 
horse and galloped away into Sussex.&nbsp; But, there galloped 
after him, on a better horse, one Alexander Iden, who came up 
with him, had a hard fight with him, and killed him.&nbsp; 
Jack&rsquo;s head was set aloft on London Bridge, with the face 
looking towards Blackheath, where he had raised his flag; and 
Alexander Iden got the thousand marks.</p>
<p>It is supposed by some, that the Duke of York, who had been 
removed from a high post abroad through the Queen&rsquo;s 
influence, and sent out of the way, to govern Ireland, was at the
bottom of this rising of Jack and his men, because he wanted to 
trouble the government.&nbsp; He claimed (though not yet 
publicly) to have a better right to the throne than Henry of 
Lancaster, as one of the family of the Earl of March, whom Henry 
the Fourth had set aside.&nbsp; Touching this claim, which, being
through female relationship, was not according to the usual 
descent, it is enough to say that Henry the Fourth was the free 
choice of the people and the Parliament, and that his family had 
now reigned undisputed for sixty years.&nbsp; The memory of Henry
the Fifth was so famous, and the English people loved it so much,
that the Duke of York&rsquo;s claim would, perhaps, never have 
been thought of (it would have been so hopeless) but for the 
unfortunate circumstance of the present King&rsquo;s being by 
this time quite an idiot, and the country very ill 
governed.&nbsp; These two circumstances gave the Duke of York a 
power he could not otherwise have had.</p>
<p>Whether the Duke knew anything of Jack Cade, or not, he came 
over from Ireland while Jack&rsquo;s head was on London Bridge; 
being secretly advised that the Queen was setting up his enemy, 
the Duke of Somerset, against him.&nbsp; He went to Westminster, 
at the head of four thousand men, and on his knees before the 
King, represented to him the bad state of the country, and 
petitioned him to summon a Parliament to consider it.&nbsp; This 
the King promised.&nbsp; When the Parliament was summoned, the 
Duke of York accused the Duke of Somerset, and the Duke of 
Somerset accused the Duke of York; and, both in and out of 
Parliament, the followers of each party were full of violence and
hatred towards the other.&nbsp; At length the Duke of York put 
himself at the head of a large force of his tenants, and, in 
arms, demanded the reformation of the Government.&nbsp; Being 
shut out of London, he encamped at Dartford, and the royal army 
encamped at Blackheath.&nbsp; According as either side triumphed,
the Duke of York was arrested, or the Duke of Somerset was 
arrested.&nbsp; The trouble ended, for the moment, in the Duke of
York renewing his oath of allegiance, and going in peace to one 
of his own castles.</p>
<p>Half a year afterwards the Queen gave birth to a son, who was 
very ill received by the people, and not believed to be the son 
of the King.&nbsp; It shows the Duke of York to have been a 
moderate man, unwilling to involve England in new troubles, that 
he did not take advantage of the general discontent at this time,
but really acted for the public good.&nbsp; He was made a member 
of the cabinet, and the King being now so much worse that he 
could not be carried about and shown to the people with any 
decency, the duke was made Lord Protector of the kingdom, until 
the King should recover, or the Prince should come of age.&nbsp; 
At the same time the Duke of Somerset was committed to the 
Tower.&nbsp; So, now the Duke of Somerset was down, and the Duke 
of York was up.&nbsp; By the end of the year, however, the King 
recovered his memory and some spark of sense; upon which the 
Queen used her power&mdash;which recovered with him&mdash;to get 
the Protector disgraced, and her favourite released.&nbsp; So now
the Duke of York was down, and the Duke of Somerset was up.</p>
<p>These ducal ups and downs gradually separated the whole nation
into the two parties of York and Lancaster, and led to those 
terrible civil wars long known as the Wars of the Red and White 
Roses, because the red rose was the badge of the House of 
Lancaster, and the white rose was the badge of the House of 
York.</p>
<p>The Duke of York, joined by some other powerful noblemen of 
the White Rose party, and leading a small army, met the King with
another small army at St. Alban&rsquo;s, and demanded that the 
Duke of Somerset should be given up.&nbsp; The poor King, being 
made to say in answer that he would sooner die, was instantly 
attacked.&nbsp; The Duke of Somerset was killed, and the King 
himself was wounded in the neck, and took refuge in the house of 
a poor tanner.&nbsp; Whereupon, the Duke of York went to him, led
him with great submission to the Abbey, and said he was very 
sorry for what had happened.&nbsp; Having now the King in his 
possession, he got a Parliament summoned and himself once more 
made Protector, but, only for a few months; for, on the King 
getting a little better again, the Queen and her party got him 
into their possession, and disgraced the Duke once more.&nbsp; 
So, now the Duke of York was down again.</p>
<p>Some of the best men in power, seeing the danger of these 
constant changes, tried even then to prevent the Red and the 
White Rose Wars.&nbsp; They brought about a great council in 
London between the two parties.&nbsp; The White Roses assembled 
in Blackfriars, the Red Roses in Whitefriars; and some good 
priests communicated between them, and made the proceedings known
at evening to the King and the judges.&nbsp; They ended in a 
peaceful agreement that there should be no more quarrelling; and 
there was a great royal procession to St. Paul&rsquo;s, in which 
the Queen walked arm-in-arm with her old enemy, the Duke of York,
to show the people how comfortable they all were.&nbsp; This 
state of peace lasted half a year, when a dispute between the 
Earl of Warwick (one of the Duke&rsquo;s powerful friends) and 
some of the King&rsquo;s servants at Court, led to an attack upon
that Earl&mdash;who was a White Rose&mdash;and to a sudden 
breaking out of all old animosities.&nbsp; So, here were greater 
ups and downs than ever.</p>
<p>There were even greater ups and downs than these, soon 
after.&nbsp; After various battles, the Duke of York fled to 
Ireland, and his son the Earl of March to Calais, with their 
friends the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick; and a Parliament was 
held declaring them all traitors.&nbsp; Little the worse for 
this, the Earl of Warwick presently came back, landed in Kent, 
was joined by the Archbishop of Canterbury and other powerful 
noblemen and gentlemen, engaged the King&rsquo;s forces at 
Northampton, signally defeated them, and took the King himself 
prisoner, who was found in his tent.&nbsp; Warwick would have 
been glad, I dare say, to have taken the Queen and Prince too, 
but they escaped into Wales and thence into Scotland.</p>
<p>The King was carried by the victorious force straight to 
London, and made to call a new Parliament, which immediately 
declared that the Duke of York and those other noblemen were not 
traitors, but excellent subjects.&nbsp; Then, back comes the Duke
from Ireland at the head of five hundred horsemen, rides from 
London to Westminster, and enters the House of Lords.&nbsp; 
There, he laid his hand upon the cloth of gold which covered the 
empty throne, as if he had half a mind to sit down in 
it&mdash;but he did not.&nbsp; On the Archbishop of Canterbury, 
asking him if he would visit the King, who was in his palace 
close by, he replied, &lsquo;I know no one in this country, my 
lord, who ought not to visit <i>me</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; None of the 
lords present spoke a single word; so, the duke went out as he 
had come in, established himself royally in the King&rsquo;s 
palace, and, six days afterwards, sent in to the Lords a formal 
statement of his claim to the throne.&nbsp; The lords went to the
King on this momentous subject, and after a great deal of 
discussion, in which the judges and the other law officers were 
afraid to give an opinion on either side, the question was 
compromised.&nbsp; It was agreed that the present King should 
retain the crown for his life, and that it should then pass to 
the Duke of York and his heirs.</p>
<p>But, the resolute Queen, determined on asserting her 
son&rsquo;s right, would hear of no such thing.&nbsp; She came 
from Scotland to the north of England, where several powerful 
lords armed in her cause.&nbsp; The Duke of York, for his part, 
set off with some five thousand men, a little time before 
Christmas Day, one thousand four hundred and sixty, to give her 
battle.&nbsp; He lodged at Sandal Castle, near Wakefield, and the
Red Roses defied him to come out on Wakefield Green, and fight 
them then and there.&nbsp; His generals said, he had best wait 
until his gallant son, the Earl of March, came up with his power;
but, he was determined to accept the challenge.&nbsp; He did so, 
in an evil hour.&nbsp; He was hotly pressed on all sides, two 
thousand of his men lay dead on Wakefield Green, and he himself 
was taken prisoner.&nbsp; They set him down in mock state on an 
ant-hill, and twisted grass about his head, and pretended to pay 
court to him on their knees, saying, &lsquo;O King, without a 
kingdom, and Prince without a people, we hope your gracious 
Majesty is very well and happy!&rsquo;&nbsp; They did worse than 
this; they cut his head off, and handed it on a pole to the 
Queen, who laughed with delight when she saw it (you recollect 
their walking so religiously and comfortably to St. 
Paul&rsquo;s!), and had it fixed, with a paper crown upon its 
head, on the walls of York.&nbsp; The Earl of Salisbury lost his 
head, too; and the Duke of York&rsquo;s second son, a handsome 
boy who was flying with his tutor over Wakefield Bridge, was 
stabbed in the heart by a murderous, lord&mdash;Lord Clifford by 
name&mdash;whose father had been killed by the White Roses in the
fight at St. Alban&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There was awful sacrifice of 
life in this battle, for no quarter was given, and the Queen was 
wild for revenge.&nbsp; When men unnaturally fight against their 
own countrymen, they are always observed to be more unnaturally 
cruel and filled with rage than they are against any other 
enemy.</p>
<p>But, Lord Clifford had stabbed the second son of the Duke of 
York&mdash;not the first.&nbsp; The eldest son, Edward Earl of 
March, was at Gloucester; and, vowing vengeance for the death of 
his father, his brother, and their faithful friends, he began to 
march against the Queen.&nbsp; He had to turn and fight a great 
body of Welsh and Irish first, who worried his advance.&nbsp; 
These he defeated in a great fight at Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross, 
near Hereford, where he beheaded a number of the Red Roses taken 
in battle, in retaliation for the beheading of the White Roses at
Wakefield.&nbsp; The Queen had the next turn of beheading.&nbsp; 
Having moved towards London, and falling in, between St. 
Alban&rsquo;s and Barnet, with the Earl of Warwick and the Duke 
of Norfolk, White Roses both, who were there with an army to 
oppose her, and had got the King with them; she defeated them 
with great loss, and struck off the heads of two prisoners of 
note, who were in the King&rsquo;s tent with him, and to whom the
King had promised his protection.&nbsp; Her triumph, however, was
very short.&nbsp; She had no treasure, and her army subsisted by 
plunder.&nbsp; This caused them to be hated and dreaded by the 
people, and particularly by the London people, who were 
wealthy.&nbsp; As soon as the Londoners heard that Edward, Earl 
of March, united with the Earl of Warwick, was advancing towards 
the city, they refused to send the Queen supplies, and made a 
great rejoicing.</p>
<p>The Queen and her men retreated with all speed, and Edward and
Warwick came on, greeted with loud acclamations on every 
side.&nbsp; The courage, beauty, and virtues of young Edward 
could not be sufficiently praised by the whole people.&nbsp; He 
rode into London like a conqueror, and met with an enthusiastic 
welcome.&nbsp; A few days afterwards, Lord Falconbridge and the 
Bishop of Exeter assembled the citizens in St. John&rsquo;s 
Field, Clerkenwell, and asked them if they would have Henry of 
Lancaster for their King?&nbsp; To this they all roared, 
&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; and &lsquo;King Edward!&nbsp; King 
Edward!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, said those noblemen, would they love 
and serve young Edward?&nbsp; To this they all cried, &lsquo;Yes,
yes!&rsquo; and threw up their caps and clapped their hands, and 
cheered tremendously.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was declared that by joining the Queen and not 
protecting those two prisoners of note, Henry of Lancaster had 
forfeited the crown; and Edward of York was proclaimed 
King.&nbsp; He made a great speech to the applauding people at 
Westminster, and sat down as sovereign of England on that throne,
on the golden covering of which his father&mdash;worthy of a 
better fate than the bloody axe which cut the thread of so many 
lives in England, through so many years&mdash;had laid his 
hand.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FOURTH</h2>
<p>King Edward the Fourth was not quite twenty-one years of age 
when he took that unquiet seat upon the throne of England.&nbsp; 
The Lancaster party, the Red Roses, were then assembling in great
numbers near York, and it was necessary to give them battle 
instantly.&nbsp; But, the stout Earl of Warwick leading for the 
young King, and the young King himself closely following him, and
the English people crowding round the Royal standard, the White 
and the Red Roses met, on a wild March day when the snow was 
falling heavily, at Towton; and there such a furious battle raged
between them, that the total loss amounted to forty thousand 
men&mdash;all Englishmen, fighting, upon English ground, against 
one another.&nbsp; The young King gained the day, took down the 
heads of his father and brother from the walls of York, and put 
up the heads of some of the most famous noblemen engaged in the 
battle on the other side.&nbsp; Then, he went to London and was 
crowned with great splendour.</p>
<p>A new Parliament met.&nbsp; No fewer than one hundred and 
fifty of the principal noblemen and gentlemen on the Lancaster 
side were declared traitors, and the King&mdash;who had very 
little humanity, though he was handsome in person and agreeable 
in manners&mdash;resolved to do all he could, to pluck up the Red
Rose root and branch.</p>
<p>Queen Margaret, however, was still active for her young 
son.&nbsp; She obtained help from Scotland and from Normandy, and
took several important English castles.&nbsp; But, Warwick soon 
retook them; the Queen lost all her treasure on board ship in a 
great storm; and both she and her son suffered great 
misfortunes.&nbsp; Once, in the winter weather, as they were 
riding through a forest, they were attacked and plundered by a 
party of robbers; and, when they had escaped from these men and 
were passing alone and on foot through a thick dark part of the 
wood, they came, all at once, upon another robber.&nbsp; So the 
Queen, with a stout heart, took the little Prince by the hand, 
and going straight up to that robber, said to him, &lsquo;My 
friend, this is the young son of your lawful King!&nbsp; I 
confide him to your care.&rsquo;&nbsp; The robber was surprised, 
but took the boy in his arms, and faithfully restored him and his
mother to their friends.&nbsp; In the end, the Queen&rsquo;s 
soldiers being beaten and dispersed, she went abroad again, and 
kept quiet for the present.</p>
<p>Now, all this time, the deposed King Henry was concealed by a 
Welsh knight, who kept him close in his castle.&nbsp; But, next 
year, the Lancaster party recovering their spirits, raised a 
large body of men, and called him out of his retirement, to put 
him at their head.&nbsp; They were joined by some powerful 
noblemen who had sworn fidelity to the new King, but who were 
ready, as usual, to break their oaths, whenever they thought 
there was anything to be got by it.&nbsp; One of the worst things
in the history of the war of the Red and White Roses, is the ease
with which these noblemen, who should have set an example of 
honour to the people, left either side as they took slight 
offence, or were disappointed in their greedy expectations, and 
joined the other.&nbsp; Well! Warwick&rsquo;s brother soon beat 
the Lancastrians, and the false noblemen, being taken, were 
beheaded without a moment&rsquo;s loss of time.&nbsp; The deposed
King had a narrow escape; three of his servants were taken, and 
one of them bore his cap of estate, which was set with pearls and
embroidered with two golden crowns.&nbsp; However, the head to 
which the cap belonged, got safely into Lancashire, and lay 
pretty quietly there (the people in the secret being very true) 
for more than a year.&nbsp; At length, an old monk gave such 
intelligence as led to Henry&rsquo;s being taken while he was 
sitting at dinner in a place called Waddington Hall.&nbsp; He was
immediately sent to London, and met at Islington by the Earl of 
Warwick, by whose directions he was put upon a horse, with his 
legs tied under it, and paraded three times round the 
pillory.&nbsp; Then, he was carried off to the Tower, where they 
treated him well enough.</p>
<p>The White Rose being so triumphant, the young King abandoned 
himself entirely to pleasure, and led a jovial life.&nbsp; But, 
thorns were springing up under his bed of roses, as he soon found
out.&nbsp; For, having been privately married to <span 
class="smcap">Elizabeth Woodville</span>, a young widow lady, 
very beautiful and very captivating; and at last resolving to 
make his secret known, and to declare her his Queen; he gave some
offence to the Earl of Warwick, who was usually called the 
King-Maker, because of his power and influence, and because of 
his having lent such great help to placing Edward on the 
throne.&nbsp; This offence was not lessened by the jealousy with 
which the Nevil family (the Earl of Warwick&rsquo;s) regarded the
promotion of the Woodville family.&nbsp; For, the young Queen was
so bent on providing for her relations, that she made her father 
an earl and a great officer of state; married her five sisters to
young noblemen of the highest rank; and provided for her younger 
brother, a young man of twenty, by marrying him to an immensely 
rich old duchess of eighty.&nbsp; The Earl of Warwick took all 
this pretty graciously for a man of his proud temper, until the 
question arose to whom the King&rsquo;s sister, <span 
class="smcap">Margaret</span>, should be married.&nbsp; The Earl 
of Warwick said, &lsquo;To one of the French King&rsquo;s 
sons,&rsquo; and was allowed to go over to the French King to 
make friendly proposals for that purpose, and to hold all manner 
of friendly interviews with him.&nbsp; But, while he was so 
engaged, the Woodville party married the young lady to the Duke 
of Burgundy!&nbsp; Upon this he came back in great rage and 
scorn, and shut himself up discontented, in his Castle of 
Middleham.</p>
<p>A reconciliation, though not a very sincere one, was patched 
up between the Earl of Warwick and the King, and lasted until the
Earl married his daughter, against the King&rsquo;s wishes, to 
the Duke of Clarence.&nbsp; While the marriage was being 
celebrated at Calais, the people in the north of England, where 
the influence of the Nevil family was strongest, broke out into 
rebellion; their complaint was, that England was oppressed and 
plundered by the Woodville family, whom they demanded to have 
removed from power.&nbsp; As they were joined by great numbers of
people, and as they openly declared that they were supported by 
the Earl of Warwick, the King did not know what to do.&nbsp; At 
last, as he wrote to the earl beseeching his aid, he and his new 
son-in-law came over to England, and began to arrange the 
business by shutting the King up in Middleham Castle in the safe 
keeping of the Archbishop of York; so England was not only in the
strange position of having two kings at once, but they were both 
prisoners at the same time.</p>
<p>Even as yet, however, the King-Maker was so far true to the 
King, that he dispersed a new rising of the Lancastrians, took 
their leader prisoner, and brought him to the King, who ordered 
him to be immediately executed.&nbsp; He presently allowed the 
King to return to London, and there innumerable pledges of 
forgiveness and friendship were exchanged between them, and 
between the Nevils and the Woodvilles; the King&rsquo;s eldest 
daughter was promised in marriage to the heir of the Nevil 
family; and more friendly oaths were sworn, and more friendly 
promises made, than this book would hold.</p>
<p>They lasted about three months.&nbsp; At the end of that time,
the Archbishop of York made a feast for the King, the Earl of 
Warwick, and the Duke of Clarence, at his house, the Moor, in 
Hertfordshire.&nbsp; The King was washing his hands before 
supper, when some one whispered him that a body of a hundred men 
were lying in ambush outside the house.&nbsp; Whether this were 
true or untrue, the King took fright, mounted his horse, and rode
through the dark night to Windsor Castle.&nbsp; Another 
reconciliation was patched up between him and the King-Maker, but
it was a short one, and it was the last.&nbsp; A new rising took 
place in Lincolnshire, and the King marched to repress it.&nbsp; 
Having done so, he proclaimed that both the Earl of Warwick and 
the Duke of Clarence were traitors, who had secretly assisted it,
and who had been prepared publicly to join it on the following 
day.&nbsp; In these dangerous circumstances they both took ship 
and sailed away to the French court.</p>
<p>And here a meeting took place between the Earl of Warwick and 
his old enemy, the Dowager Queen Margaret, through whom his 
father had had his head struck off, and to whom he had been a 
bitter foe.&nbsp; But, now, when he said that he had done with 
the ungrateful and perfidious Edward of York, and that henceforth
he devoted himself to the restoration of the House of Lancaster, 
either in the person of her husband or of her little son, she 
embraced him as if he had ever been her dearest friend.&nbsp; She
did more than that; she married her son to his second daughter, 
the Lady Anne.&nbsp; However agreeable this marriage was to the 
new friends, it was very disagreeable to the Duke of Clarence, 
who perceived that his father-in-law, the King-Maker, would never
make <i>him</i> King, now.&nbsp; So, being but a weak-minded 
young traitor, possessed of very little worth or sense, he 
readily listened to an artful court lady sent over for the 
purpose, and promised to turn traitor once more, and go over to 
his brother, King Edward, when a fitting opportunity should 
come.</p>
<p>The Earl of Warwick, knowing nothing of this, soon redeemed 
his promise to the Dowager Queen Margaret, by invading England 
and landing at Plymouth, where he instantly proclaimed King 
Henry, and summoned all Englishmen between the ages of sixteen 
and sixty, to join his banner.&nbsp; Then, with his army 
increasing as he marched along, he went northward, and came so 
near King Edward, who was in that part of the country, that 
Edward had to ride hard for it to the coast of Norfolk, and 
thence to get away in such ships as he could find, to 
Holland.&nbsp; Thereupon, the triumphant King-Maker and his false
son-in-law, the Duke of Clarence, went to London, took the old 
King out of the Tower, and walked him in a great procession to 
Saint Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral with the crown upon his head.&nbsp; 
This did not improve the temper of the Duke of Clarence, who saw 
himself farther off from being King than ever; but he kept his 
secret, and said nothing.&nbsp; The Nevil family were restored to
all their honours and glories, and the Woodvilles and the rest 
were disgraced.&nbsp; The King-Maker, less sanguinary than the 
King, shed no blood except that of the Earl of Worcester, who had
been so cruel to the people as to have gained the title of the 
Butcher.&nbsp; Him they caught hidden in a tree, and him they 
tried and executed.&nbsp; No other death stained the 
King-Maker&rsquo;s triumph.</p>
<p>To dispute this triumph, back came King Edward again, next 
year, landing at Ravenspur, coming on to York, causing all his 
men to cry &lsquo;Long live King Henry!&rsquo; and swearing on 
the altar, without a blush, that he came to lay no claim to the 
crown.&nbsp; Now was the time for the Duke of Clarence, who 
ordered his men to assume the White Rose, and declare for his 
brother.&nbsp; The Marquis of Montague, though the Earl of 
Warwick&rsquo;s brother, also declining to fight against King 
Edward, he went on successfully to London, where the Archbishop 
of York let him into the City, and where the people made great 
demonstrations in his favour.&nbsp; For this they had four 
reasons.&nbsp; Firstly, there were great numbers of the 
King&rsquo;s adherents hiding in the City and ready to break out;
secondly, the King owed them a great deal of money, which they 
could never hope to get if he were unsuccessful; thirdly, there 
was a young prince to inherit the crown; and fourthly, the King 
was gay and handsome, and more popular than a better man might 
have been with the City ladies.&nbsp; After a stay of only two 
days with these worthy supporters, the King marched out to Barnet
Common, to give the Earl of Warwick battle.&nbsp; And now it was 
to be seen, for the last time, whether the King or the King-Maker
was to carry the day.</p>
<p>While the battle was yet pending, the fainthearted Duke of 
Clarence began to repent, and sent over secret messages to his 
father-in-law, offering his services in mediation with the 
King.&nbsp; But, the Earl of Warwick disdainfully rejected them, 
and replied that Clarence was false and perjured, and that he 
would settle the quarrel by the sword.&nbsp; The battle began at 
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning and lasted until ten, and 
during the greater part of the time it was fought in a thick 
mist&mdash;absurdly supposed to be raised by a magician.&nbsp; 
The loss of life was very great, for the hatred was strong on 
both sides.&nbsp; The King-Maker was defeated, and the King 
triumphed.&nbsp; Both the Earl of Warwick and his brother were 
slain, and their bodies lay in St. Paul&rsquo;s, for some days, 
as a spectacle to the people.</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s spirit was not broken even by this great 
blow.&nbsp; Within five days she was in arms again, and raised 
her standard in Bath, whence she set off with her army, to try 
and join Lord Pembroke, who had a force in Wales.&nbsp; But, the 
King, coming up with her outside the town of Tewkesbury, and 
ordering his brother, the <span class="smcap">Duke of 
Gloucester</span>, who was a brave soldier, to attack her men, 
she sustained an entire defeat, and was taken prisoner, together 
with her son, now only eighteen years of age.&nbsp; The conduct 
of the King to this poor youth was worthy of his cruel 
character.&nbsp; He ordered him to be led into his tent.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;brought <i>you</i> to 
England?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I came to England,&rsquo; replied 
the prisoner, with a spirit which a man of spirit might have 
admired in a captive, &lsquo;to recover my father&rsquo;s 
kingdom, which descended to him as his right, and from him 
descends to me, as mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The King, drawing off his 
iron gauntlet, struck him with it in the face; and the Duke of 
Clarence and some other lords, who were there, drew their noble 
swords, and killed him.</p>
<p>His mother survived him, a prisoner, for five years; after her
ransom by the King of France, she survived for six years 
more.&nbsp; Within three weeks of this murder, Henry died one of 
those convenient sudden deaths which were so common in the Tower;
in plainer words, he was murdered by the King&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>Having no particular excitement on his hands after this great 
defeat of the Lancaster party, and being perhaps desirous to get 
rid of some of his fat (for he was now getting too corpulent to 
be handsome), the King thought of making war on France.&nbsp; As 
he wanted more money for this purpose than the Parliament could 
give him, though they were usually ready enough for war, he 
invented a new way of raising it, by sending for the principal 
citizens of London, and telling them, with a grave face, that he 
was very much in want of cash, and would take it very kind in 
them if they would lend him some.&nbsp; It being impossible for 
them safely to refuse, they complied, and the moneys thus forced 
from them were called&mdash;no doubt to the great amusement of 
the King and the Court&mdash;as if they were free gifts, 
&lsquo;Benevolences.&rsquo;&nbsp; What with grants from 
Parliament, and what with Benevolences, the King raised an army 
and passed over to Calais.&nbsp; As nobody wanted war, however, 
the French King made proposals of peace, which were accepted, and
a truce was concluded for seven long years.&nbsp; The proceedings
between the Kings of France and England on this occasion, were 
very friendly, very splendid, and very distrustful.&nbsp; They 
finished with a meeting between the two Kings, on a temporary 
bridge over the river Somme, where they embraced through two 
holes in a strong wooden grating like a lion&rsquo;s cage, and 
made several bows and fine speeches to one another.</p>
<p>It was time, now, that the Duke of Clarence should be punished
for his treacheries; and Fate had his punishment in store.&nbsp; 
He was, probably, not trusted by the King&mdash;for who could 
trust him who knew him!&mdash;and he had certainly a powerful 
opponent in his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who, being 
avaricious and ambitious, wanted to marry that widowed daughter 
of the Earl of Warwick&rsquo;s who had been espoused to the 
deceased young Prince, at Calais.&nbsp; Clarence, who wanted all 
the family wealth for himself, secreted this lady, whom Richard 
found disguised as a servant in the City of London, and whom he 
married; arbitrators appointed by the King, then divided the 
property between the brothers.&nbsp; This led to ill-will and 
mistrust between them.&nbsp; Clarence&rsquo;s wife dying, and he 
wishing to make another marriage, which was obnoxious to the 
King, his ruin was hurried by that means, too.&nbsp; At first, 
the Court struck at his retainers and dependents, and accused 
some of them of magic and witchcraft, and similar nonsense.&nbsp;
Successful against this small game, it then mounted to the Duke 
himself, who was impeached by his brother the King, in person, on
a variety of such charges.&nbsp; He was found guilty, and 
sentenced to be publicly executed.&nbsp; He never was publicly 
executed, but he met his death somehow, in the Tower, and, no 
doubt, through some agency of the King or his brother Gloucester,
or both.&nbsp; It was supposed at the time that he was told to 
choose the manner of his death, and that he chose to be drowned 
in a butt of Malmsey wine.&nbsp; I hope the story may be true, 
for it would have been a becoming death for such a miserable 
creature.</p>
<p>The King survived him some five years.&nbsp; He died in the 
forty-second year of his life, and the twenty-third of his 
reign.&nbsp; He had a very good capacity and some good points, 
but he was selfish, careless, sensual, and cruel.&nbsp; He was a 
favourite with the people for his showy manners; and the people 
were a good example to him in the constancy of their 
attachment.&nbsp; He was penitent on his death-bed for his 
&lsquo;benevolences,&rsquo; and other extortions, and ordered 
restitution to be made to the people who had suffered from 
them.&nbsp; He also called about his bed the enriched members of 
the Woodville family, and the proud lords whose honours were of 
older date, and endeavoured to reconcile them, for the sake of 
the peaceful succession of his son and the tranquillity of 
England.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIFTH</h2>
<p>The late King&rsquo;s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, called 
<span class="smcap">Edward</span> after him, was only thirteen 
years of age at his father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He was at Ludlow 
Castle with his uncle, the Earl of Rivers.&nbsp; The 
prince&rsquo;s brother, the Duke of York, only eleven years of 
age, was in London with his mother.&nbsp; The boldest, most 
crafty, and most dreaded nobleman in England at that time was 
their uncle <span class="smcap">Richard</span>, Duke of 
Gloucester, and everybody wondered how the two poor boys would 
fare with such an uncle for a friend or a foe.</p>
<p>The Queen, their mother, being exceedingly uneasy about this, 
was anxious that instructions should be sent to Lord Rivers to 
raise an army to escort the young King safely to London.&nbsp; 
But, Lord Hastings, who was of the Court party opposed to the 
Woodvilles, and who disliked the thought of giving them that 
power, argued against the proposal, and obliged the Queen to be 
satisfied with an escort of two thousand horse.&nbsp; The Duke of
Gloucester did nothing, at first, to justify suspicion.&nbsp; He 
came from Scotland (where he was commanding an army) to York, and
was there the first to swear allegiance to his nephew.&nbsp; He 
then wrote a condoling letter to the Queen-Mother, and set off to
be present at the coronation in London.</p>
<p>Now, the young King, journeying towards London too, with Lord 
Rivers and Lord Gray, came to Stony Stratford, as his uncle came 
to Northampton, about ten miles distant; and when those two lords
heard that the Duke of Gloucester was so near, they proposed to 
the young King that they should go back and greet him in his 
name.&nbsp; The boy being very willing that they should do so, 
they rode off and were received with great friendliness, and 
asked by the Duke of Gloucester to stay and dine with him.&nbsp; 
In the evening, while they were merry together, up came the Duke 
of Buckingham with three hundred horsemen; and next morning the 
two lords and the two dukes, and the three hundred horsemen, rode
away together to rejoin the King.&nbsp; Just as they were 
entering Stony Stratford, the Duke of Gloucester, checking his 
horse, turned suddenly on the two lords, charged them with 
alienating from him the affections of his sweet nephew, and 
caused them to be arrested by the three hundred horsemen and 
taken back.&nbsp; Then, he and the Duke of Buckingham went 
straight to the King (whom they had now in their power), to whom 
they made a show of kneeling down, and offering great love and 
submission; and then they ordered his attendants to disperse, and
took him, alone with them, to Northampton.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards they conducted him to London, and lodged
him in the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp; But, he did not remain 
there long; for, the Duke of Buckingham with a tender face made a
speech expressing how anxious he was for the Royal boy&rsquo;s 
safety, and how much safer he would be in the Tower until his 
coronation, than he could be anywhere else.&nbsp; So, to the 
Tower he was taken, very carefully, and the Duke of Gloucester 
was named Protector of the State.</p>
<p>Although Gloucester had proceeded thus far with a very smooth 
countenance&mdash;and although he was a clever man, fair of 
speech, and not ill-looking, in spite of one of his shoulders 
being something higher than the other&mdash;and although he had 
come into the City riding bare-headed at the King&rsquo;s side, 
and looking very fond of him&mdash;he had made the King&rsquo;s 
mother more uneasy yet; and when the Royal boy was taken to the 
Tower, she became so alarmed that she took sanctuary in 
Westminster with her five daughters.</p>
<p>Nor did she do this without reason, for, the Duke of 
Gloucester, finding that the lords who were opposed to the 
Woodville family were faithful to the young King nevertheless, 
quickly resolved to strike a blow for himself.&nbsp; Accordingly,
while those lords met in council at the Tower, he and those who 
were in his interest met in separate council at his own 
residence, Crosby Palace, in Bishopsgate Street.&nbsp; Being at 
last quite prepared, he one day appeared unexpectedly at the 
council in the Tower, and appeared to be very jocular and 
merry.&nbsp; He was particularly gay with the Bishop of Ely: 
praising the strawberries that grew in his garden on Holborn 
Hill, and asking him to have some gathered that he might eat them
at dinner.&nbsp; The Bishop, quite proud of the honour, sent one 
of his men to fetch some; and the Duke, still very jocular and 
gay, went out; and the council all said what a very agreeable 
duke he was!&nbsp; In a little time, however, he came back quite 
altered&mdash;not at all jocular&mdash;frowning and 
fierce&mdash;and suddenly said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do those persons deserve who have compassed my 
destruction; I being the King&rsquo;s lawful, as well as natural,
protector?&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this strange question, Lord Hastings replied, that they 
deserved death, whosoever they were.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Duke, &lsquo;I tell you that they
are that sorceress my brother&rsquo;s wife;&rsquo; meaning the 
Queen: &lsquo;and that other sorceress, Jane Shore.&nbsp; Who, by
witchcraft, have withered my body, and caused my arm to shrink as
I now show you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then pulled up his sleeve and showed them his arm, which 
was shrunken, it is true, but which had been so, as they all very
well knew, from the hour of his birth.</p>
<p>Jane Shore, being then the lover of Lord Hastings, as she had 
formerly been of the late King, that lord knew that he himself 
was attacked.&nbsp; So, he said, in some confusion, 
&lsquo;Certainly, my Lord, if they have done this, they be worthy
of punishment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If?&rsquo; said the Duke of Gloucester; &lsquo;do you 
talk to me of ifs?&nbsp; I tell you that they <i>have</i> so 
done, and I will make it good upon thy body, thou 
traitor!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that, he struck the table a great blow with his 
fist.&nbsp; This was a signal to some of his people outside to 
cry &lsquo;Treason!&rsquo;&nbsp; They immediately did so, and 
there was a rush into the chamber of so many armed men that it 
was filled in a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;First,&rsquo; said the Duke of Gloucester to Lord 
Hastings, &lsquo;I arrest thee, traitor!&nbsp; And let 
him,&rsquo; he added to the armed men who took him, &lsquo;have a
priest at once, for by St. Paul I will not dine until I have seen
his head of!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Hastings was hurried to the green by the Tower chapel, 
and there beheaded on a log of wood that happened to be lying on 
the ground.&nbsp; Then, the Duke dined with a good appetite, and 
after dinner summoning the principal citizens to attend him, told
them that Lord Hastings and the rest had designed to murder both 
himself and the Duke if Buckingham, who stood by his side, if he 
had not providentially discovered their design.&nbsp; He 
requested them to be so obliging as to inform their 
fellow-citizens of the truth of what he said, and issued a 
proclamation (prepared and neatly copied out beforehand) to the 
same effect.</p>
<p>On the same day that the Duke did these things in the Tower, 
Sir Richard Ratcliffe, the boldest and most undaunted of his men,
went down to Pontefract; arrested Lord Rivers, Lord Gray, and two
other gentlemen; and publicly executed them on the scaffold, 
without any trial, for having intended the Duke&rsquo;s 
death.&nbsp; Three days afterwards the Duke, not to lose time, 
went down the river to Westminster in his barge, attended by 
divers bishops, lords, and soldiers, and demanded that the Queen 
should deliver her second son, the Duke of York, into his safe 
keeping.&nbsp; The Queen, being obliged to comply, resigned the 
child after she had wept over him; and Richard of Gloucester 
placed him with his brother in the Tower.&nbsp; Then, he seized 
Jane Shore, and, because she had been the lover of the late King,
confiscated her property, and got her sentenced to do public 
penance in the streets by walking in a scanty dress, with bare 
feet, and carrying a lighted candle, to St. Paul&rsquo;s 
Cathedral, through the most crowded part of the City.</p>
<p>Having now all things ready for his own advancement, he caused
a friar to preach a sermon at the cross which stood in front of 
St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, in which he dwelt upon the profligate
manners of the late King, and upon the late shame of Jane Shore, 
and hinted that the princes were not his children.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Whereas, good people,&rsquo; said the friar, whose name 
was <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>, &lsquo;my Lord the 
Protector, the noble Duke of Gloucester, that sweet prince, the 
pattern of all the noblest virtues, is the perfect image and 
express likeness of his father.&rsquo;&nbsp; There had been a 
little plot between the Duke and the friar, that the Duke should 
appear in the crowd at this moment, when it was expected that the
people would cry &lsquo;Long live King Richard!&rsquo;&nbsp; But,
either through the friar saying the words too soon, or through 
the Duke&rsquo;s coming too late, the Duke and the words did not 
come together, and the people only laughed, and the friar sneaked
off ashamed.</p>
<p>The Duke of Buckingham was a better hand at such business than
the friar, so he went to the Guildhall the next day, and 
addressed the citizens in the Lord Protector&rsquo;s 
behalf.&nbsp; A few dirty men, who had been hired and stationed 
there for the purpose, crying when he had done, &lsquo;God save 
King Richard!&rsquo; he made them a great bow, and thanked them 
with all his heart.&nbsp; Next day, to make an end of it, he went
with the mayor and some lords and citizens to Bayard Castle, by 
the river, where Richard then was, and read an address, humbly 
entreating him to accept the Crown of England.&nbsp; Richard, who
looked down upon them out of a window and pretended to be in 
great uneasiness and alarm, assured them there was nothing he 
desired less, and that his deep affection for his nephews forbade
him to think of it.&nbsp; To this the Duke of Buckingham replied,
with pretended warmth, that the free people of England would 
never submit to his nephew&rsquo;s rule, and that if Richard, who
was the lawful heir, refused the Crown, why then they must find 
some one else to wear it.&nbsp; The Duke of Gloucester returned, 
that since he used that strong language, it became his painful 
duty to think no more of himself, and to accept the Crown.</p>
<p>Upon that, the people cheered and dispersed; and the Duke of 
Gloucester and the Duke of Buckingham passed a pleasant evening, 
talking over the play they had just acted with so much success, 
and every word of which they had prepared together.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE THIRD</h2>
<p>King Richard the Third was up betimes in the morning, and went
to Westminster Hall.&nbsp; In the Hall was a marble seat, upon 
which he sat himself down between two great noblemen, and told 
the people that he began the new reign in that place, because the
first duty of a sovereign was to administer the laws equally to 
all, and to maintain justice.&nbsp; He then mounted his horse and
rode back to the City, where he was received by the clergy and 
the crowd as if he really had a right to the throne, and really 
were a just man.&nbsp; The clergy and the crowd must have been 
rather ashamed of themselves in secret, I think, for being such 
poor-spirited knaves.</p>
<p>The new King and his Queen were soon crowned with a great deal
of show and noise, which the people liked very much; and then the
King set forth on a royal progress through his dominions.&nbsp; 
He was crowned a second time at York, in order that the people 
might have show and noise enough; and wherever he went was 
received with shouts of rejoicing&mdash;from a good many people 
of strong lungs, who were paid to strain their throats in crying,
&lsquo;God save King Richard!&rsquo;&nbsp; The plan was so 
successful that I am told it has been imitated since, by other 
usurpers, in other progresses through other dominions.</p>
<p>While he was on this journey, King Richard stayed a week at 
Warwick.&nbsp; And from Warwick he sent instructions home for one
of the wickedest murders that ever was done&mdash;the murder of 
the two young princes, his nephews, who were shut up in the Tower
of London.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Brackenbury was at that time Governor of the 
Tower.&nbsp; To him, by the hands of a messenger named <span 
class="smcap">John Green</span>, did King Richard send a letter, 
ordering him by some means to put the two young princes to 
death.&nbsp; But Sir Robert&mdash;I hope because he had children 
of his own, and loved them&mdash;sent John Green back again, 
riding and spurring along the dusty roads, with the answer that 
he could not do so horrible a piece of work.&nbsp; The King, 
having frowningly considered a little, called to him <span 
class="smcap">Sir James Tyrrel</span>, his master of the horse, 
and to him gave authority to take command of the Tower, whenever 
he would, for twenty-four hours, and to keep all the keys of the 
Tower during that space of time.&nbsp; Tyrrel, well knowing what 
was wanted, looked about him for two hardened ruffians, and chose
<span class="smcap">John Dighton</span>, one of his own grooms, 
and <span class="smcap">Miles Forest</span>, who was a murderer 
by trade.&nbsp; Having secured these two assistants, he went, 
upon a day in August, to the Tower, showed his authority from the
King, took the command for four-and-twenty hours, and obtained 
possession of the keys.&nbsp; And when the black night came he 
went creeping, creeping, like a guilty villain as he was, up the 
dark, stone winding stairs, and along the dark stone passages, 
until he came to the door of the room where the two young 
princes, having said their prayers, lay fast asleep, clasped in 
each other&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; And while he watched and listened 
at the door, he sent in those evil demons, John Dighton and Miles
Forest, who smothered the two princes with the bed and pillows, 
and carried their bodies down the stairs, and buried them under a
great heap of stones at the staircase foot.&nbsp; And when the 
day came, he gave up the command of the Tower, and restored the 
keys, and hurried away without once looking behind him; and Sir 
Robert Brackenbury went with fear and sadness to the 
princes&rsquo; room, and found the princes gone for ever.</p>
<p>You know, through all this history, how true it is that 
traitors are never true, and you will not be surprised to learn 
that the Duke of Buckingham soon turned against King Richard, and
joined a great conspiracy that was formed to dethrone him, and to
place the crown upon its rightful owner&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; 
Richard had meant to keep the murder secret; but when he heard 
through his spies that this conspiracy existed, and that many 
lords and gentlemen drank in secret to the healths of the two 
young princes in the Tower, he made it known that they were 
dead.&nbsp; The conspirators, though thwarted for a moment, soon 
resolved to set up for the crown against the murderous Richard, 
<span class="smcap">Henry</span> Earl of Richmond, grandson of 
Catherine: that widow of Henry the Fifth who married Owen 
Tudor.&nbsp; And as Henry was of the house of Lancaster, they 
proposed that he should marry the Princess Elizabeth, the eldest 
daughter of the late King, now the heiress of the house of York, 
and thus by uniting the rival families put an end to the fatal 
wars of the Red and White Roses.&nbsp; All being settled, a time 
was appointed for Henry to come over from Brittany, and for a 
great rising against Richard to take place in several parts of 
England at the same hour.&nbsp; On a certain day, therefore, in 
October, the revolt took place; but unsuccessfully.&nbsp; Richard
was prepared, Henry was driven back at sea by a storm, his 
followers in England were dispersed, and the Duke of Buckingham 
was taken, and at once beheaded in the market-place at 
Salisbury.</p>
<p>The time of his success was a good time, Richard thought, for 
summoning a Parliament and getting some money.&nbsp; So, a 
Parliament was called, and it flattered and fawned upon him as 
much as he could possibly desire, and declared him to be the 
rightful King of England, and his only son Edward, then eleven 
years of age, the next heir to the throne.</p>
<p>Richard knew full well that, let the Parliament say what it 
would, the Princess Elizabeth was remembered by people as the 
heiress of the house of York; and having accurate information 
besides, of its being designed by the conspirators to marry her 
to Henry of Richmond, he felt that it would much strengthen him 
and weaken them, to be beforehand with them, and marry her to his
son.&nbsp; With this view he went to the Sanctuary at 
Westminster, where the late King&rsquo;s widow and her daughter 
still were, and besought them to come to Court: where (he swore 
by anything and everything) they should be safely and honourably 
entertained.&nbsp; They came, accordingly, but had scarcely been 
at Court a month when his son died suddenly&mdash;or was 
poisoned&mdash;and his plan was crushed to pieces.</p>
<p>In this extremity, King Richard, always active, thought, 
&lsquo;I must make another plan.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he made the 
plan of marrying the Princess Elizabeth himself, although she was
his niece.&nbsp; There was one difficulty in the way: his wife, 
the Queen Anne, was alive.&nbsp; But, he knew (remembering his 
nephews) how to remove that obstacle, and he made love to the 
Princess Elizabeth, telling her he felt perfectly confident that 
the Queen would die in February.&nbsp; The Princess was not a 
very scrupulous young lady, for, instead of rejecting the 
murderer of her brothers with scorn and hatred, she openly 
declared she loved him dearly; and, when February came and the 
Queen did not die, she expressed her impatient opinion that she 
was too long about it.&nbsp; However, King Richard was not so far
out in his prediction, but, that she died in March&mdash;he took 
good care of that&mdash;and then this precious pair hoped to be 
married.&nbsp; But they were disappointed, for the idea of such a
marriage was so unpopular in the country, that the King&rsquo;s 
chief counsellors, <span class="smcap">Ratcliffe</span> and <span
class="smcap">Catesby</span>, would by no means undertake to 
propose it, and the King was even obliged to declare in public 
that he had never thought of such a thing.</p>
<p>He was, by this time, dreaded and hated by all classes of his 
subjects.&nbsp; His nobles deserted every day to Henry&rsquo;s 
side; he dared not call another Parliament, lest his crimes 
should be denounced there; and for want of money, he was obliged 
to get Benevolences from the citizens, which exasperated them all
against him.&nbsp; It was said too, that, being stricken by his 
conscience, he dreamed frightful dreams, and started up in the 
night-time, wild with terror and remorse.&nbsp; Active to the 
last, through all this, he issued vigorous proclamations against 
Henry of Richmond and all his followers, when he heard that they 
were coming against him with a Fleet from France; and took the 
field as fierce and savage as a wild boar&mdash;the animal 
represented on his shield.</p>
<p>Henry of Richmond landed with six thousand men at Milford 
Haven, and came on against King Richard, then encamped at 
Leicester with an army twice as great, through North Wales.&nbsp;
On Bosworth Field the two armies met; and Richard, looking along 
Henry&rsquo;s ranks, and seeing them crowded with the English 
nobles who had abandoned him, turned pale when he beheld the 
powerful Lord Stanley and his son (whom he had tried hard to 
retain) among them.&nbsp; But, he was as brave as he was wicked, 
and plunged into the thickest of the fight.&nbsp; He was riding 
hither and thither, laying about him in all directions, when he 
observed the Earl of Northumberland&mdash;one of his few great 
allies&mdash;to stand inactive, and the main body of his troops 
to hesitate.&nbsp; At the same moment, his desperate glance 
caught Henry of Richmond among a little group of his 
knights.&nbsp; Riding hard at him, and crying 
&lsquo;Treason!&rsquo; he killed his standard-bearer, fiercely 
unhorsed another gentleman, and aimed a powerful stroke at Henry 
himself, to cut him down.&nbsp; But, Sir William Stanley parried 
it as it fell, and before Richard could raise his arm again, he 
was borne down in a press of numbers, unhorsed, and killed.&nbsp;
Lord Stanley picked up the crown, all bruised and trampled, and 
stained with blood, and put it upon Richmond&rsquo;s head, amid 
loud and rejoicing cries of &lsquo;Long live King 
Henry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That night, a horse was led up to the church of the Grey 
Friars at Leicester; across whose back was tied, like some 
worthless sack, a naked body brought there for burial.&nbsp; It 
was the body of the last of the Plantagenet line, King Richard 
the Third, usurper and murderer, slain at the battle of Bosworth 
Field in the thirty-second year of his age, after a reign of two 
years.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SEVENTH</h2>
<p>King Henry the Seventh did not turn out to be as fine a fellow
as the nobility and people hoped, in the first joy of their 
deliverance from Richard the Third.&nbsp; He was very cold, 
crafty, and calculating, and would do almost anything for 
money.&nbsp; He possessed considerable ability, but his chief 
merit appears to have been that he was not cruel when there was 
nothing to be got by it.</p>
<p>The new King had promised the nobles who had espoused his 
cause that he would marry the Princess Elizabeth.&nbsp; The first
thing he did, was, to direct her to be removed from the castle of
Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire, where Richard had placed her, and 
restored to the care of her mother in London.&nbsp; The young 
Earl of Warwick, Edward Plantagenet, son and heir of the late 
Duke of Clarence, had been kept a prisoner in the same old 
Yorkshire Castle with her.&nbsp; This boy, who was now fifteen, 
the new King placed in the Tower for safety.&nbsp; Then he came 
to London in great state, and gratified the people with a fine 
procession; on which kind of show he often very much relied for 
keeping them in good humour.&nbsp; The sports and feasts which 
took place were followed by a terrible fever, called the Sweating
Sickness; of which great numbers of people died.&nbsp; Lord 
Mayors and Aldermen are thought to have suffered most from it; 
whether, because they were in the habit of over-eating 
themselves, or because they were very jealous of preserving filth
and nuisances in the City (as they have been since), I 
don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s coronation was postponed on account of the 
general ill-health, and he afterwards deferred his marriage, as 
if he were not very anxious that it should take place: and, even 
after that, deferred the Queen&rsquo;s coronation so long that he
gave offence to the York party.&nbsp; However, he set these 
things right in the end, by hanging some men and seizing on the 
rich possessions of others; by granting more popular pardons to 
the followers of the late King than could, at first, be got from 
him; and, by employing about his Court, some very scrupulous 
persons who had been employed in the previous reign.</p>
<p>As this reign was principally remarkable for two very curious 
impostures which have become famous in history, we will make 
those two stories its principal feature.</p>
<p>There was a priest at Oxford of the name of Simons, who had 
for a pupil a handsome boy named Lambert Simnel, the son of a 
baker.&nbsp; Partly to gratify his own ambitious ends, and partly
to carry out the designs of a secret party formed against the 
King, this priest declared that his pupil, the boy, was no other 
than the young Earl of Warwick; who (as everybody might have 
known) was safely locked up in the Tower of London.&nbsp; The 
priest and the boy went over to Ireland; and, at Dublin, enlisted
in their cause all ranks of the people: who seem to have been 
generous enough, but exceedingly irrational.&nbsp; The Earl of 
Kildare, the governor of Ireland, declared that he believed the 
boy to be what the priest represented; and the boy, who had been 
well tutored by the priest, told them such things of his 
childhood, and gave them so many descriptions of the Royal 
Family, that they were perpetually shouting and hurrahing, and 
drinking his health, and making all kinds of noisy and thirsty 
demonstrations, to express their belief in him.&nbsp; Nor was 
this feeling confined to Ireland alone, for the Earl of 
Lincoln&mdash;whom the late usurper had named as his 
successor&mdash;went over to the young Pretender; and, after 
holding a secret correspondence with the Dowager Duchess of 
Burgundy&mdash;the sister of Edward the Fourth, who detested the 
present King and all his race&mdash;sailed to Dublin with two 
thousand German soldiers of her providing.&nbsp; In this 
promising state of the boy&rsquo;s fortunes, he was crowned 
there, with a crown taken off the head of a statue of the Virgin 
Mary; and was then, according to the Irish custom of those days, 
carried home on the shoulders of a big chieftain possessing a 
great deal more strength than sense.&nbsp; Father Simons, you may
be sure, was mighty busy at the coronation.</p>
<p>Ten days afterwards, the Germans, and the Irish, and the 
priest, and the boy, and the Earl of Lincoln, all landed in 
Lancashire to invade England.&nbsp; The King, who had good 
intelligence of their movements, set up his standard at 
Nottingham, where vast numbers resorted to him every day; while 
the Earl of Lincoln could gain but very few.&nbsp; With his small
force he tried to make for the town of Newark; but the 
King&rsquo;s army getting between him and that place, he had no 
choice but to risk a battle at Stoke.&nbsp; It soon ended in the 
complete destruction of the Pretender&rsquo;s forces, one half of
whom were killed; among them, the Earl himself.&nbsp; The priest 
and the baker&rsquo;s boy were taken prisoners.&nbsp; The priest,
after confessing the trick, was shut up in prison, where he 
afterwards died&mdash;suddenly perhaps.&nbsp; The boy was taken 
into the King&rsquo;s kitchen and made a turnspit.&nbsp; He was 
afterwards raised to the station of one of the King&rsquo;s 
falconers; and so ended this strange imposition.</p>
<p>There seems reason to suspect that the Dowager 
Queen&mdash;always a restless and busy woman&mdash;had had some 
share in tutoring the baker&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; The King was very 
angry with her, whether or no.&nbsp; He seized upon her property,
and shut her up in a convent at Bermondsey.</p>
<p>One might suppose that the end of this story would have put 
the Irish people on their guard; but they were quite ready to 
receive a second impostor, as they had received the first, and 
that same troublesome Duchess of Burgundy soon gave them the 
opportunity.&nbsp; All of a sudden there appeared at Cork, in a 
vessel arriving from Portugal, a young man of excellent 
abilities, of very handsome appearance and most winning manners, 
who declared himself to be Richard, Duke of York, the second son 
of King Edward the Fourth.&nbsp; &lsquo;O,&rsquo; said some, even
of those ready Irish believers, &lsquo;but surely that young 
Prince was murdered by his uncle in the 
Tower!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It <i>is</i> supposed so,&rsquo; said 
the engaging young man; &lsquo;and my brother <i>was</i> killed 
in that gloomy prison; but I escaped&mdash;it don&rsquo;t matter 
how, at present&mdash;and have been wandering about the world for
seven long years.&rsquo;&nbsp; This explanation being quite 
satisfactory to numbers of the Irish people, they began again to 
shout and to hurrah, and to drink his health, and to make the 
noisy and thirsty demonstrations all over again.&nbsp; And the 
big chieftain in Dublin began to look out for another coronation,
and another young King to be carried home on his back.</p>
<p>Now, King Henry being then on bad terms with France, the 
French King, Charles the Eighth, saw that, by pretending to 
believe in the handsome young man, he could trouble his enemy 
sorely.&nbsp; So, he invited him over to the French Court, and 
appointed him a body-guard, and treated him in all respects as if
he really were the Duke of York.&nbsp; Peace, however, being soon
concluded between the two Kings, the pretended Duke was turned 
adrift, and wandered for protection to the Duchess of 
Burgundy.&nbsp; She, after feigning to inquire into the reality 
of his claims, declared him to be the very picture of her dear 
departed brother; gave him a body-guard at her Court, of thirty 
halberdiers; and called him by the sounding name of the White 
Rose of England.</p>
<p>The leading members of the White Rose party in England sent 
over an agent, named Sir Robert Clifford, to ascertain whether 
the White Rose&rsquo;s claims were good: the King also sent over 
his agents to inquire into the Rose&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; The 
White Roses declared the young man to be really the Duke of York;
the King declared him to be <span class="smcap">Perkin 
Warbeck</span>, the son of a merchant of the city of Tournay, who
had acquired his knowledge of England, its language and manners, 
from the English merchants who traded in Flanders; it was also 
stated by the Royal agents that he had been in the service of 
Lady Brompton, the wife of an exiled English nobleman, and that 
the Duchess of Burgundy had caused him to be trained and taught, 
expressly for this deception.&nbsp; The King then required the 
Archduke Philip&mdash;who was the sovereign of Burgundy&mdash;to 
banish this new Pretender, or to deliver him up; but, as the 
Archduke replied that he could not control the Duchess in her own
land, the King, in revenge, took the market of English cloth away
from Antwerp, and prevented all commercial intercourse between 
the two countries.</p>
<p>He also, by arts and bribes, prevailed on Sir Robert Clifford 
to betray his employers; and he denouncing several famous English
noblemen as being secretly the friends of Perkin Warbeck, the 
King had three of the foremost executed at once.&nbsp; Whether he
pardoned the remainder because they were poor, I do not know; but
it is only too probable that he refused to pardon one famous 
nobleman against whom the same Clifford soon afterwards informed 
separately, because he was rich.&nbsp; This was no other than Sir
William Stanley, who had saved the King&rsquo;s life at the 
battle of Bosworth Field.&nbsp; It is very doubtful whether his 
treason amounted to much more than his having said, that if he 
were sure the young man was the Duke of York, he would not take 
arms against him.&nbsp; Whatever he had done he admitted, like an
honourable spirit; and he lost his head for it, and the covetous 
King gained all his wealth.</p>
<p>Perkin Warbeck kept quiet for three years; but, as the 
Flemings began to complain heavily of the loss of their trade by 
the stoppage of the Antwerp market on his account, and as it was 
not unlikely that they might even go so far as to take his life, 
or give him up, he found it necessary to do something.&nbsp; 
Accordingly he made a desperate sally, and landed, with only a 
few hundred men, on the coast of Deal.&nbsp; But he was soon glad
to get back to the place from whence he came; for the country 
people rose against his followers, killed a great many, and took 
a hundred and fifty prisoners: who were all driven to London, 
tied together with ropes, like a team of cattle.&nbsp; Every one 
of them was hanged on some part or other of the sea-shore; in 
order, that if any more men should come over with Perkin Warbeck,
they might see the bodies as a warning before they landed.</p>
<p>Then the wary King, by making a treaty of commerce with the 
Flemings, drove Perkin Warbeck out of that country; and, by 
completely gaining over the Irish to his side, deprived him of 
that asylum too.&nbsp; He wandered away to Scotland, and told his
story at that Court.&nbsp; King James the Fourth of Scotland, who
was no friend to King Henry, and had no reason to be (for King 
Henry had bribed his Scotch lords to betray him more than once; 
but had never succeeded in his plots), gave him a great 
reception, called him his cousin, and gave him in marriage the 
Lady Catherine Gordon, a beautiful and charming creature related 
to the royal house of Stuart.</p>
<p>Alarmed by this successful reappearance of the Pretender, the 
King still undermined, and bought, and bribed, and kept his 
doings and Perkin Warbeck&rsquo;s story in the dark, when he 
might, one would imagine, have rendered the matter clear to all 
England.&nbsp; But, for all this bribing of the Scotch lords at 
the Scotch King&rsquo;s Court, he could not procure the Pretender
to be delivered up to him.&nbsp; James, though not very 
particular in many respects, would not betray him; and the 
ever-busy Duchess of Burgundy so provided him with arms, and good
soldiers, and with money besides, that he had soon a little army 
of fifteen hundred men of various nations.&nbsp; With these, and 
aided by the Scottish King in person, he crossed the border into 
England, and made a proclamation to the people, in which he 
called the King &lsquo;Henry Tudor;&rsquo; offered large rewards 
to any who should take or distress him; and announced himself as 
King Richard the Fourth come to receive the homage of his 
faithful subjects.&nbsp; His faithful subjects, however, cared 
nothing for him, and hated his faithful troops: who, being of 
different nations, quarrelled also among themselves.&nbsp; Worse 
than this, if worse were possible, they began to plunder the 
country; upon which the White Rose said, that he would rather 
lose his rights, than gain them through the miseries of the 
English people.&nbsp; The Scottish King made a jest of his 
scruples; but they and their whole force went back again without 
fighting a battle.</p>
<p>The worst consequence of this attempt was, that a rising took 
place among the people of Cornwall, who considered themselves too
heavily taxed to meet the charges of the expected war.&nbsp; 
Stimulated by Flammock, a lawyer, and Joseph, a blacksmith, and 
joined by Lord Audley and some other country gentlemen, they 
marched on all the way to Deptford Bridge, where they fought a 
battle with the King&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; They were 
defeated&mdash;though the Cornish men fought with great 
bravery&mdash;and the lord was beheaded, and the lawyer and the 
blacksmith were hanged, drawn, and quartered.&nbsp; The rest were
pardoned.&nbsp; The King, who believed every man to be as 
avaricious as himself, and thought that money could settle 
anything, allowed them to make bargains for their liberty with 
the soldiers who had taken them.</p>
<p>Perkin Warbeck, doomed to wander up and down, and never to 
find rest anywhere&mdash;a sad fate: almost a sufficient 
punishment for an imposture, which he seems in time to have half 
believed himself&mdash;lost his Scottish refuge through a truce 
being made between the two Kings; and found himself, once more, 
without a country before him in which he could lay his 
head.&nbsp; But James (always honourable and true to him, alike 
when he melted down his plate, and even the great gold chain he 
had been used to wear, to pay soldiers in his cause; and now, 
when that cause was lost and hopeless) did not conclude the 
treaty, until he had safely departed out of the Scottish 
dominions.&nbsp; He, and his beautiful wife, who was faithful to 
him under all reverses, and left her state and home to follow his
poor fortunes, were put aboard ship with everything necessary for
their comfort and protection, and sailed for Ireland.</p>
<p>But, the Irish people had had enough of counterfeit Earls of 
Warwick and Dukes of York, for one while; and would give the 
White Rose no aid.&nbsp; So, the White Rose&mdash;encircled by 
thorns indeed&mdash;resolved to go with his beautiful wife to 
Cornwall as a forlorn resource, and see what might be made of the
Cornish men, who had risen so valiantly a little while before, 
and who had fought so bravely at Deptford Bridge.</p>
<p>To Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall, accordingly, came Perkin Warbeck
and his wife; and the lovely lady he shut up for safety in the 
Castle of St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, and then marched into 
Devonshire at the head of three thousand Cornishmen.&nbsp; These 
were increased to six thousand by the time of his arrival in 
Exeter; but, there the people made a stout resistance, and he 
went on to Taunton, where he came in sight of the King&rsquo;s 
army.&nbsp; The stout Cornish men, although they were few in 
number, and badly armed, were so bold, that they never thought of
retreating; but bravely looked forward to a battle on the 
morrow.&nbsp; Unhappily for them, the man who was possessed of so
many engaging qualities, and who attracted so many people to his 
side when he had nothing else with which to tempt them, was not 
as brave as they.&nbsp; In the night, when the two armies lay 
opposite to each other, he mounted a swift horse and fled.&nbsp; 
When morning dawned, the poor confiding Cornish men, discovering 
that they had no leader, surrendered to the King&rsquo;s 
power.&nbsp; Some of them were hanged, and the rest were pardoned
and went miserably home.</p>
<p>Before the King pursued Perkin Warbeck to the sanctuary of 
Beaulieu in the New Forest, where it was soon known that he had 
taken refuge, he sent a body of horsemen to St. Michael&rsquo;s 
Mount, to seize his wife.&nbsp; She was soon taken and brought as
a captive before the King.&nbsp; But she was so beautiful, and so
good, and so devoted to the man in whom she believed, that the 
King regarded her with compassion, treated her with great 
respect, and placed her at Court, near the Queen&rsquo;s 
person.&nbsp; And many years after Perkin Warbeck was no more, 
and when his strange story had become like a nursery tale, 
<i>she</i> was called the White Rose, by the people, in 
remembrance of her beauty.</p>
<p>The sanctuary at Beaulieu was soon surrounded by the 
King&rsquo;s men; and the King, pursuing his usual dark, artful 
ways, sent pretended friends to Perkin Warbeck to persuade him to
come out and surrender himself.&nbsp; This he soon did; the King 
having taken a good look at the man of whom he had heard so 
much&mdash;from behind a screen&mdash;directed him to be well 
mounted, and to ride behind him at a little distance, guarded, 
but not bound in any way.&nbsp; So they entered London with the 
King&rsquo;s favourite show&mdash;a procession; and some of the 
people hooted as the Pretender rode slowly through the streets to
the Tower; but the greater part were quiet, and very curious to 
see him.&nbsp; From the Tower, he was taken to the Palace at 
Westminster, and there lodged like a gentleman, though closely 
watched.&nbsp; He was examined every now and then as to his 
imposture; but the King was so secret in all he did, that even 
then he gave it a consequence, which it cannot be supposed to 
have in itself deserved.</p>
<p>At last Perkin Warbeck ran away, and took refuge in another 
sanctuary near Richmond in Surrey.&nbsp; From this he was again 
persuaded to deliver himself up; and, being conveyed to London, 
he stood in the stocks for a whole day, outside Westminster Hall,
and there read a paper purporting to be his full confession, and 
relating his history as the King&rsquo;s agents had originally 
described it.&nbsp; He was then shut up in the Tower again, in 
the company of the Earl of Warwick, who had now been there for 
fourteen years: ever since his removal out of Yorkshire, except 
when the King had had him at Court, and had shown him to the 
people, to prove the imposture of the Baker&rsquo;s boy.&nbsp; It
is but too probable, when we consider the crafty character of 
Henry the Seventh, that these two were brought together for a 
cruel purpose.&nbsp; A plot was soon discovered between them and 
the keepers, to murder the Governor, get possession of the keys, 
and proclaim Perkin Warbeck as King Richard the Fourth.&nbsp; 
That there was some such plot, is likely; that they were tempted 
into it, is at least as likely; that the unfortunate Earl of 
Warwick&mdash;last male of the Plantagenet line&mdash;was too 
unused to the world, and too ignorant and simple to know much 
about it, whatever it was, is perfectly certain; and that it was 
the King&rsquo;s interest to get rid of him, is no less so.&nbsp;
He was beheaded on Tower Hill, and Perkin Warbeck was hanged at 
Tyburn.</p>
<p>Such was the end of the pretended Duke of York, whose shadowy 
history was made more shadowy&mdash;and ever will be&mdash;by the
mystery and craft of the King.&nbsp; If he had turned his great 
natural advantages to a more honest account, he might have lived 
a happy and respected life, even in those days.&nbsp; But he died
upon a gallows at Tyburn, leaving the Scottish lady, who had 
loved him so well, kindly protected at the Queen&rsquo;s 
Court.&nbsp; After some time she forgot her old loves and 
troubles, as many people do with Time&rsquo;s merciful 
assistance, and married a Welsh gentleman.&nbsp; Her second 
husband, <span class="smcap">Sir Matthew Cradoc</span>, more 
honest and more happy than her first, lies beside her in a tomb 
in the old church of Swansea.</p>
<p>The ill-blood between France and England in this reign, arose 
out of the continued plotting of the Duchess of Burgundy, and 
disputes respecting the affairs of Brittany.&nbsp; The King 
feigned to be very patriotic, indignant, and warlike; but he 
always contrived so as never to make war in reality, and always 
to make money.&nbsp; His taxation of the people, on pretence of 
war with France, involved, at one time, a very dangerous 
insurrection, headed by Sir John Egremont, and a common man 
called John &agrave; Chambre.&nbsp; But it was subdued by the 
royal forces, under the command of the Earl of Surrey.&nbsp; The 
knighted John escaped to the Duchess of Burgundy, who was ever 
ready to receive any one who gave the King trouble; and the plain
John was hanged at York, in the midst of a number of his men, but
on a much higher gibbet, as being a greater traitor.&nbsp; Hung 
high or hung low, however, hanging is much the same to the person
hung.</p>
<p>Within a year after her marriage, the Queen had given birth to
a son, who was called Prince Arthur, in remembrance of the old 
British prince of romance and story; and who, when all these 
events had happened, being then in his fifteenth year, was 
married to <span class="smcap">Catherine</span>, the daughter of 
the Spanish monarch, with great rejoicings and bright prospects; 
but in a very few months he sickened and died.&nbsp; As soon as 
the King had recovered from his grief, he thought it a pity that 
the fortune of the Spanish Princess, amounting to two hundred 
thousand crowns, should go out of the family; and therefore 
arranged that the young widow should marry his second son <span 
class="smcap">Henry</span>, then twelve years of age, when he too
should be fifteen.&nbsp; There were objections to this marriage 
on the part of the clergy; but, as the infallible Pope was gained
over, and, as he <i>must</i> be right, that settled the business 
for the time.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s eldest daughter was provided
for, and a long course of disturbance was considered to be set at
rest, by her being married to the Scottish King.</p>
<p>And now the Queen died.&nbsp; When the King had got over that 
grief too, his mind once more reverted to his darling money for 
consolation, and he thought of marrying the Dowager Queen of 
Naples, who was immensely rich: but, as it turned out not to be 
practicable to gain the money however practicable it might have 
been to gain the lady, he gave up the idea.&nbsp; He was not so 
fond of her but that he soon proposed to marry the Dowager 
Duchess of Savoy; and, soon afterwards, the widow of the King of 
Castile, who was raving mad.&nbsp; But he made a money-bargain 
instead, and married neither.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Burgundy, among the other discontented people 
to whom she had given refuge, had sheltered <span 
class="smcap">Edmund de la Pole</span> (younger brother of that 
Earl of Lincoln who was killed at Stoke), now Earl of 
Suffolk.&nbsp; The King had prevailed upon him to return to the 
marriage of Prince Arthur; but, he soon afterwards went away 
again; and then the King, suspecting a conspiracy, resorted to 
his favourite plan of sending him some treacherous friends, and 
buying of those scoundrels the secrets they disclosed or 
invented.&nbsp; Some arrests and executions took place in 
consequence.&nbsp; In the end, the King, on a promise of not 
taking his life, obtained possession of the person of Edmund de 
la Pole, and shut him up in the Tower.</p>
<p>This was his last enemy.&nbsp; If he had lived much longer he 
would have made many more among the people, by the grinding 
exaction to which he constantly exposed them, and by the 
tyrannical acts of his two prime favourites in all money-raising 
matters, <span class="smcap">Edmund Dudley</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Richard Empson</span>.&nbsp; But Death&mdash;the 
enemy who is not to be bought off or deceived, and on whom no 
money, and no treachery has any effect&mdash;presented himself at
this juncture, and ended the King&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; He died of
the gout, on the twenty-second of April, one thousand five 
hundred and nine, and in the fifty-third year of his age, after 
reigning twenty-four years; he was buried in the beautiful Chapel
of Westminster Abbey, which he had himself founded, and which 
still bears his name.</p>
<p>It was in this reign that the great <span 
class="smcap">Christopher Columbus</span>, on behalf of Spain, 
discovered what was then called The New World.&nbsp; Great 
wonder, interest, and hope of wealth being awakened in England 
thereby, the King and the merchants of London and Bristol fitted 
out an English expedition for further discoveries in the New 
World, and entrusted it to <span class="smcap">Sebastian 
Cabot</span>, of Bristol, the son of a Venetian pilot 
there.&nbsp; He was very successful in his voyage, and gained 
high reputation, both for himself and England.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH, CALLED 
BLUFF KING HAL AND BURLY KING HARRY</h2>
<h3>PART THE FIRST</h3>
<p>We now come to King Henry the Eighth, whom it has been too 
much the fashion to call &lsquo;Bluff King Hal,&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Burly King Harry,&rsquo; and other fine names; but whom I 
shall take the liberty to call, plainly, one of the most 
detestable villains that ever drew breath.&nbsp; You will be able
to judge, long before we come to the end of his life, whether he 
deserves the character.</p>
<p>He was just eighteen years of age when he came to the 
throne.&nbsp; People said he was handsome then; but I don&rsquo;t
believe it.&nbsp; He was a big, burly, noisy, small-eyed, 
large-faced, double-chinned, swinish-looking fellow in later life
(as we know from the likenesses of him, painted by the famous 
<span class="smcap">Hans Holbein</span>), and it is not easy to 
believe that so bad a character can ever have been veiled under a
prepossessing appearance.</p>
<p>He was anxious to make himself popular; and the people, who 
had long disliked the late King, were very willing to believe 
that he deserved to be so.&nbsp; He was extremely fond of show 
and display, and so were they.&nbsp; Therefore there was great 
rejoicing when he married the Princess Catherine, and when they 
were both crowned.&nbsp; And the King fought at tournaments and 
always came off victorious&mdash;for the courtiers took care of 
that&mdash;and there was a general outcry that he was a wonderful
man.&nbsp; Empson, Dudley, and their supporters were accused of a
variety of crimes they had never committed, instead of the 
offences of which they really had been guilty; and they were 
pilloried, and set upon horses with their faces to the tails, and
knocked about and beheaded, to the satisfaction of the people, 
and the enrichment of the King.</p>
<p>The Pope, so indefatigable in getting the world into trouble, 
had mixed himself up in a war on the continent of Europe, 
occasioned by the reigning Princes of little quarrelling states 
in Italy having at various times married into other Royal 
families, and so led to <i>their</i> claiming a share in those 
petty Governments.&nbsp; The King, who discovered that he was 
very fond of the Pope, sent a herald to the King of France, to 
say that he must not make war upon that holy personage, because 
he was the father of all Christians.&nbsp; As the French King did
not mind this relationship in the least, and also refused to 
admit a claim King Henry made to certain lands in France, war was
declared between the two countries.&nbsp; Not to perplex this 
story with an account of the tricks and designs of all the 
sovereigns who were engaged in it, it is enough to say that 
England made a blundering alliance with Spain, and got stupidly 
taken in by that country; which made its own terms with France 
when it could and left England in the lurch.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Sir Edward Howard</span>, a bold admiral, son of 
the Earl of Surrey, distinguished himself by his bravery against 
the French in this business; but, unfortunately, he was more 
brave than wise, for, skimming into the French harbour of Brest 
with only a few row-boats, he attempted (in revenge for the 
defeat and death of <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas 
Knyvett</span>, another bold English admiral) to take some strong
French ships, well defended with batteries of cannon.&nbsp; The 
upshot was, that he was left on board of one of them (in 
consequence of its shooting away from his own boat), with not 
more than about a dozen men, and was thrown into the sea and 
drowned: though not until he had taken from his breast his gold 
chain and gold whistle, which were the signs of his office, and 
had cast them into the sea to prevent their being made a boast of
by the enemy.&nbsp; After this defeat&mdash;which was a great 
one, for Sir Edward Howard was a man of valour and fame&mdash;the
King took it into his head to invade France in person; first 
executing that dangerous Earl of Suffolk whom his father had left
in the Tower, and appointing Queen Catherine to the charge of his
kingdom in his absence.&nbsp; He sailed to Calais, where he was 
joined by <span class="smcap">Maximilian</span>, Emperor of 
Germany, who pretended to be his soldier, and who took pay in his
service: with a good deal of nonsense of that sort, flattering 
enough to the vanity of a vain blusterer.&nbsp; The King might be
successful enough in sham fights; but his idea of real battles 
chiefly consisted in pitching silken tents of bright colours that
were ignominiously blown down by the wind, and in making a vast 
display of gaudy flags and golden curtains.&nbsp; Fortune, 
however, favoured him better than he deserved; for, after much 
waste of time in tent pitching, flag flying, gold curtaining, and
other such masquerading, he gave the French battle at a place 
called Guinegate: where they took such an unaccountable panic, 
and fled with such swiftness, that it was ever afterwards called 
by the English the Battle of Spurs.&nbsp; Instead of following up
his advantage, the King, finding that he had had enough of real 
fighting, came home again.</p>
<p>The Scottish King, though nearly related to Henry by marriage,
had taken part against him in this war.&nbsp; The Earl of Surrey,
as the English general, advanced to meet him when he came out of 
his own dominions and crossed the river Tweed.&nbsp; The two 
armies came up with one another when the Scottish King had also 
crossed the river Till, and was encamped upon the last of the 
Cheviot Hills, called the Hill of Flodden.&nbsp; Along the plain 
below it, the English, when the hour of battle came, 
advanced.&nbsp; The Scottish army, which had been drawn up in 
five great bodies, then came steadily down in perfect 
silence.&nbsp; So they, in their turn, advanced to meet the 
English army, which came on in one long line; and they attacked 
it with a body of spearmen, under <span class="smcap">Lord 
Home</span>.&nbsp; At first they had the best of it; but the 
English recovered themselves so bravely, and fought with such 
valour, that, when the Scottish King had almost made his way up 
to the Royal Standard, he was slain, and the whole Scottish power
routed.&nbsp; Ten thousand Scottish men lay dead that day on 
Flodden Field; and among them, numbers of the nobility and 
gentry.&nbsp; For a long time afterwards, the Scottish peasantry 
used to believe that their King had not been really killed in 
this battle, because no Englishman had found an iron belt he wore
about his body as a penance for having been an unnatural and 
undutiful son.&nbsp; But, whatever became of his belt, the 
English had his sword and dagger, and the ring from his finger, 
and his body too, covered with wounds.&nbsp; There is no doubt of
it; for it was seen and recognised by English gentlemen who had 
known the Scottish King well.</p>
<p>When King Henry was making ready to renew the war in France, 
the French King was contemplating peace.&nbsp; His queen, dying 
at this time, he proposed, though he was upwards of fifty years 
old, to marry King Henry&rsquo;s sister, the Princess Mary, who, 
besides being only sixteen, was betrothed to the Duke of 
Suffolk.&nbsp; As the inclinations of young Princesses were not 
much considered in such matters, the marriage was concluded, and 
the poor girl was escorted to France, where she was immediately 
left as the French King&rsquo;s bride, with only one of all her 
English attendants.&nbsp; That one was a pretty young girl named 
<span class="smcap">Anne Boleyn</span>, niece of the Earl of 
Surrey, who had been made Duke of Norfolk, after the victory of 
Flodden Field.&nbsp; Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s is a name to be 
remembered, as you will presently find.</p>
<p>And now the French King, who was very proud of his young wife,
was preparing for many years of happiness, and she was looking 
forward, I dare say, to many years of misery, when he died within
three months, and left her a young widow.&nbsp; The new French 
monarch, <span class="smcap">Francis the First</span>, seeing how
important it was to his interests that she should take for her 
second husband no one but an Englishman, advised her first lover,
the Duke of Suffolk, when King Henry sent him over to France to 
fetch her home, to marry her.&nbsp; The Princess being herself so
fond of that Duke, as to tell him that he must either do so then,
or for ever lose her, they were wedded; and Henry afterwards 
forgave them.&nbsp; In making interest with the King, the Duke of
Suffolk had addressed his most powerful favourite and adviser, 
<span class="smcap">Thomas Wolsey</span>&mdash;a name very famous
in history for its rise and downfall.</p>
<p>Wolsey was the son of a respectable butcher at Ipswich, in 
Suffolk and received so excellent an education that he became a 
tutor to the family of the Marquis of Dorset, who afterwards got 
him appointed one of the late King&rsquo;s chaplains.&nbsp; On 
the accession of Henry the Eighth, he was promoted and taken into
great favour.&nbsp; He was now Archbishop of York; the Pope had 
made him a Cardinal besides; and whoever wanted influence in 
England or favour with the King&mdash;whether he were a foreign 
monarch or an English nobleman&mdash;was obliged to make a friend
of the great Cardinal Wolsey.</p>
<p>He was a gay man, who could dance and jest, and sing and 
drink; and those were the roads to so much, or rather so little, 
of a heart as King Henry had.&nbsp; He was wonderfully fond of 
pomp and glitter, and so was the King.&nbsp; He knew a good deal 
of the Church learning of that time; much of which consisted in 
finding artful excuses and pretences for almost any wrong thing, 
and in arguing that black was white, or any other colour.&nbsp; 
This kind of learning pleased the King too.&nbsp; For many such 
reasons, the Cardinal was high in estimation with the King; and, 
being a man of far greater ability, knew as well how to manage 
him, as a clever keeper may know how to manage a wolf or a tiger,
or any other cruel and uncertain beast, that may turn upon him 
and tear him any day.&nbsp; Never had there been seen in England 
such state as my Lord Cardinal kept.&nbsp; His wealth was 
enormous; equal, it was reckoned, to the riches of the 
Crown.&nbsp; His palaces were as splendid as the King&rsquo;s, 
and his retinue was eight hundred strong.&nbsp; He held his 
Court, dressed out from top to toe in flaming scarlet; and his 
very shoes were golden, set with precious stones.&nbsp; His 
followers rode on blood horses; while he, with a wonderful 
affectation of humility in the midst of his great splendour, 
ambled on a mule with a red velvet saddle and bridle and golden 
stirrups.</p>
<p>Through the influence of this stately priest, a grand meeting 
was arranged to take place between the French and English Kings 
in France; but on ground belonging to England.&nbsp; A prodigious
show of friendship and rejoicing was to be made on the occasion; 
and heralds were sent to proclaim with brazen trumpets through 
all the principal cities of Europe, that, on a certain day, the 
Kings of France and England, as companions and brothers in arms, 
each attended by eighteen followers, would hold a tournament 
against all knights who might choose to come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>, the new Emperor of Germany
(the old one being dead), wanted to prevent too cordial an 
alliance between these sovereigns, and came over to England 
before the King could repair to the place of meeting; and, 
besides making an agreeable impression upon him, secured 
Wolsey&rsquo;s interest by promising that his influence should 
make him Pope when the next vacancy occurred.&nbsp; On the day 
when the Emperor left England, the King and all the Court went 
over to Calais, and thence to the place of meeting, between 
Ardres and Guisnes, commonly called the Field of the Cloth of 
Gold.&nbsp; Here, all manner of expense and prodigality was 
lavished on the decorations of the show; many of the knights and 
gentlemen being so superbly dressed that it was said they carried
their whole estates upon their shoulders.</p>
<p>There were sham castles, temporary chapels, fountains running 
wine, great cellars full of wine free as water to all comers, 
silk tents, gold lace and foil, gilt lions, and such things 
without end; and, in the midst of all, the rich Cardinal 
out-shone and out-glittered all the noblemen and gentlemen 
assembled.&nbsp; After a treaty made between the two Kings with 
as much solemnity as if they had intended to keep it, the 
lists&mdash;nine hundred feet long, and three hundred and twenty 
broad&mdash;were opened for the tournament; the Queens of France 
and England looking on with great array of lords and 
ladies.&nbsp; Then, for ten days, the two sovereigns fought five 
combats every day, and always beat their polite adversaries; 
though they <i>do</i> write that the King of England, being 
thrown in a wrestle one day by the King of France, lost his 
kingly temper with his brother-in-arms, and wanted to make a 
quarrel of it.&nbsp; Then, there is a great story belonging to 
this Field of the Cloth of Gold, showing how the English were 
distrustful of the French, and the French of the English, until 
Francis rode alone one morning to Henry&rsquo;s tent; and, going 
in before he was out of bed, told him in joke that he was his 
prisoner; and how Henry jumped out of bed and embraced Francis; 
and how Francis helped Henry to dress, and warmed his linen for 
him; and how Henry gave Francis a splendid jewelled collar, and 
how Francis gave Henry, in return, a costly bracelet.&nbsp; All 
this and a great deal more was so written about, and sung about, 
and talked about at that time (and, indeed, since that time too),
that the world has had good cause to be sick of it, for ever.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing came of all these fine doings but a speedy 
renewal of the war between England and France, in which the two 
Royal companions and brothers in arms longed very earnestly to 
damage one another.&nbsp; But, before it broke out again, the 
Duke of Buckingham was shamefully executed on Tower Hill, on the 
evidence of a discharged servant&mdash;really for nothing, except
the folly of having believed in a friar of the name of <span 
class="smcap">Hopkins</span>, who had pretended to be a prophet, 
and who had mumbled and jumbled out some nonsense about the 
Duke&rsquo;s son being destined to be very great in the 
land.&nbsp; It was believed that the unfortunate Duke had given 
offence to the great Cardinal by expressing his mind freely about
the expense and absurdity of the whole business of the Field of 
the Cloth of Gold.&nbsp; At any rate, he was beheaded, as I have 
said, for nothing.&nbsp; And the people who saw it done were very
angry, and cried out that it was the work of &lsquo;the 
butcher&rsquo;s son!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The new war was a short one, though the Earl of Surrey invaded
France again, and did some injury to that country.&nbsp; It ended
in another treaty of peace between the two kingdoms, and in the 
discovery that the Emperor of Germany was not such a good friend 
to England in reality, as he pretended to be.&nbsp; Neither did 
he keep his promise to Wolsey to make him Pope, though the King 
urged him.&nbsp; Two Popes died in pretty quick succession; but 
the foreign priests were too much for the Cardinal, and kept him 
out of the post.&nbsp; So the Cardinal and King together found 
out that the Emperor of Germany was not a man to keep faith with;
broke off a projected marriage between the King&rsquo;s daughter 
<span class="smcap">Mary</span>, Princess of Wales, and that 
sovereign; and began to consider whether it might not be well to 
marry the young lady, either to Francis himself, or to his eldest
son.</p>
<p>There now arose at Wittemberg, in Germany, the great leader of
the mighty change in England which is called The Reformation, and
which set the people free from their slavery to the 
priests.&nbsp; This was a learned Doctor, named <span 
class="smcap">Martin Luther</span>, who knew all about them, for 
he had been a priest, and even a monk, himself.&nbsp; The 
preaching and writing of Wickliffe had set a number of men 
thinking on this subject; and Luther, finding one day to his 
great surprise, that there really was a book called the New 
Testament which the priests did not allow to be read, and which 
contained truths that they suppressed, began to be very vigorous 
against the whole body, from the Pope downward.&nbsp; It 
happened, while he was yet only beginning his vast work of 
awakening the nation, that an impudent fellow named <span 
class="smcap">Tetzel</span>, a friar of very bad character, came 
into his neighbourhood selling what were called Indulgences, by 
wholesale, to raise money for beautifying the great Cathedral of 
St. Peter&rsquo;s, at Rome.&nbsp; Whoever bought an Indulgence of
the Pope was supposed to buy himself off from the punishment of 
Heaven for his offences.&nbsp; Luther told the people that these 
Indulgences were worthless bits of paper, before God, and that 
Tetzel and his masters were a crew of impostors in selling 
them.</p>
<p>The King and the Cardinal were mightily indignant at this 
presumption; and the King (with the help of <span 
class="smcap">Sir Thomas More</span>, a wise man, whom he 
afterwards repaid by striking off his head) even wrote a book 
about it, with which the Pope was so well pleased that he gave 
the King the title of Defender of the Faith.&nbsp; The King and 
the Cardinal also issued flaming warnings to the people not to 
read Luther&rsquo;s books, on pain of excommunication.&nbsp; But 
they did read them for all that; and the rumour of what was in 
them spread far and wide.</p>
<p>When this great change was thus going on, the King began to 
show himself in his truest and worst colours.&nbsp; Anne Boleyn, 
the pretty little girl who had gone abroad to France with his 
sister, was by this time grown up to be very beautiful, and was 
one of the ladies in attendance on Queen Catherine.&nbsp; Now, 
Queen Catherine was no longer young or handsome, and it is likely
that she was not particularly good-tempered; having been always 
rather melancholy, and having been made more so by the deaths of 
four of her children when they were very young.&nbsp; So, the 
King fell in love with the fair Anne Boleyn, and said to himself,
&lsquo;How can I be best rid of my own troublesome wife whom I am
tired of, and marry Anne?&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p0b.jpg">
<img alt="Catherine was old, so he fell in love with Anne Boleyn"
src="images/p0s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>You recollect that Queen Catherine had been the wife of 
Henry&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; What does the King do, after 
thinking it over, but calls his favourite priests about him, and 
says, O! his mind is in such a dreadful state, and he is so 
frightfully uneasy, because he is afraid it was not lawful for 
him to marry the Queen!&nbsp; Not one of those priests had the 
courage to hint that it was rather curious he had never thought 
of that before, and that his mind seemed to have been in a 
tolerably jolly condition during a great many years, in which he 
certainly had not fretted himself thin; but, they all said, Ah! 
that was very true, and it was a serious business; and perhaps 
the best way to make it right, would be for his Majesty to be 
divorced!&nbsp; The King replied, Yes, he thought that would be 
the best way, certainly; so they all went to work.</p>
<p>If I were to relate to you the intrigues and plots that took 
place in the endeavour to get this divorce, you would think the 
History of England the most tiresome book in the world.&nbsp; So 
I shall say no more, than that after a vast deal of negotiation 
and evasion, the Pope issued a commission to Cardinal Wolsey and 
<span class="smcap">Cardinal Campeggio</span> (whom he sent over 
from Italy for the purpose), to try the whole case in 
England.&nbsp; It is supposed&mdash;and I think with 
reason&mdash;that Wolsey was the Queen&rsquo;s enemy, because she
had reproved him for his proud and gorgeous manner of life.&nbsp;
But, he did not at first know that the King wanted to marry Anne 
Boleyn; and when he did know it, he even went down on his knees, 
in the endeavour to dissuade him.</p>
<p>The Cardinals opened their court in the Convent of the Black 
Friars, near to where the bridge of that name in London now 
stands; and the King and Queen, that they might be near it, took 
up their lodgings at the adjoining palace of Bridewell, of which 
nothing now remains but a bad prison.&nbsp; On the opening of the
court, when the King and Queen were called on to appear, that 
poor ill-used lady, with a dignity and firmness and yet with a 
womanly affection worthy to be always admired, went and kneeled 
at the King&rsquo;s feet, and said that she had come, a stranger,
to his dominions; that she had been a good and true wife to him 
for twenty years; and that she could acknowledge no power in 
those Cardinals to try whether she should be considered his wife 
after all that time, or should be put away.&nbsp; With that, she 
got up and left the court, and would never afterwards come back 
to it.</p>
<p>The King pretended to be very much overcome, and said, O! my 
lords and gentlemen, what a good woman she was to be sure, and 
how delighted he would be to live with her unto death, but for 
that terrible uneasiness in his mind which was quite wearing him 
away!&nbsp; So, the case went on, and there was nothing but talk 
for two months.&nbsp; Then Cardinal Campeggio, who, on behalf of 
the Pope, wanted nothing so much as delay, adjourned it for two 
more months; and before that time was elapsed, the Pope himself 
adjourned it indefinitely, by requiring the King and Queen to 
come to Rome and have it tried there.&nbsp; But by good luck for 
the King, word was brought to him by some of his people, that 
they had happened to meet at supper, <span class="smcap">Thomas 
Cranmer</span>, a learned Doctor of Cambridge, who had proposed 
to urge the Pope on, by referring the case to all the learned 
doctors and bishops, here and there and everywhere, and getting 
their opinions that the King&rsquo;s marriage was unlawful.&nbsp;
The King, who was now in a hurry to marry Anne Boleyn, thought 
this such a good idea, that he sent for Cranmer, post haste, and 
said to <span class="smcap">Lord Rochfort</span>, Anne 
Boleyn&rsquo;s father, &lsquo;Take this learned Doctor down to 
your country-house, and there let him have a good room for a 
study, and no end of books out of which to prove that I may marry
your daughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord Rochfort, not at all reluctant, 
made the learned Doctor as comfortable as he could; and the 
learned Doctor went to work to prove his case.&nbsp; All this 
time, the King and Anne Boleyn were writing letters to one 
another almost daily, full of impatience to have the case 
settled; and Anne Boleyn was showing herself (as I think) very 
worthy of the fate which afterwards befel her.</p>
<p>It was bad for Cardinal Wolsey that he had left Cranmer to 
render this help.&nbsp; It was worse for him that he had tried to
dissuade the King from marrying Anne Boleyn.&nbsp; Such a servant
as he, to such a master as Henry, would probably have fallen in 
any case; but, between the hatred of the party of the Queen that 
was, and the hatred of the party of the Queen that was to be, he 
fell suddenly and heavily.&nbsp; Going down one day to the Court 
of Chancery, where he now presided, he was waited upon by the 
Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, who told him that they brought an 
order to him to resign that office, and to withdraw quietly to a 
house he had at Esher, in Surrey.&nbsp; The Cardinal refusing, 
they rode off to the King; and next day came back with a letter 
from him, on reading which, the Cardinal submitted.&nbsp; An 
inventory was made out of all the riches in his palace at York 
Place (now Whitehall), and he went sorrowfully up the river, in 
his barge, to Putney.&nbsp; An abject man he was, in spite of his
pride; for being overtaken, riding out of that place towards 
Esher, by one of the King&rsquo;s chamberlains who brought him a 
kind message and a ring, he alighted from his mule, took off his 
cap, and kneeled down in the dirt.&nbsp; His poor Fool, whom in 
his prosperous days he had always kept in his palace to entertain
him, cut a far better figure than he; for, when the Cardinal said
to the chamberlain that he had nothing to send to his lord the 
King as a present, but that jester who was a most excellent one, 
it took six strong yeomen to remove the faithful fool from his 
master.</p>
<p>The once proud Cardinal was soon further disgraced, and wrote 
the most abject letters to his vile sovereign; who humbled him 
one day and encouraged him the next, according to his humour, 
until he was at last ordered to go and reside in his diocese of 
York.&nbsp; He said he was too poor; but I don&rsquo;t know how 
he made that out, for he took a hundred and sixty servants with 
him, and seventy-two cart-loads of furniture, food, and 
wine.&nbsp; He remained in that part of the country for the best 
part of a year, and showed himself so improved by his 
misfortunes, and was so mild and so conciliating, that he won all
hearts.&nbsp; And indeed, even in his proud days, he had done 
some magnificent things for learning and education.&nbsp; At 
last, he was arrested for high treason; and, coming slowly on his
journey towards London, got as far as Leicester.&nbsp; Arriving 
at Leicester Abbey after dark, and very ill, he said&mdash;when 
the monks came out at the gate with lighted torches to receive 
him&mdash;that he had come to lay his bones among them.&nbsp; He 
had indeed; for he was taken to a bed, from which he never rose 
again.&nbsp; His last words were, &lsquo;Had I but served God as 
diligently as I have served the King, He would not have given me 
over, in my grey hairs.&nbsp; Howbeit, this is my just reward for
my pains and diligence, not regarding my service to God, but only
my duty to my prince.&rsquo;&nbsp; The news of his death was 
quickly carried to the King, who was amusing himself with archery
in the garden of the magnificent Palace at Hampton Court, which 
that very Wolsey had presented to him.&nbsp; The greatest emotion
his royal mind displayed at the loss of a servant so faithful and
so ruined, was a particular desire to lay hold of fifteen hundred
pounds which the Cardinal was reported to have hidden 
somewhere.</p>
<p>The opinions concerning the divorce, of the learned doctors 
and bishops and others, being at last collected, and being 
generally in the King&rsquo;s favour, were forwarded to the Pope,
with an entreaty that he would now grant it.&nbsp; The 
unfortunate Pope, who was a timid man, was half distracted 
between his fear of his authority being set aside in England if 
he did not do as he was asked, and his dread of offending the 
Emperor of Germany, who was Queen Catherine&rsquo;s nephew.&nbsp;
In this state of mind he still evaded and did nothing.&nbsp; 
Then, <span class="smcap">Thomas Cromwell</span>, who had been 
one of Wolsey&rsquo;s faithful attendants, and had remained so 
even in his decline, advised the King to take the matter into his
own hands, and make himself the head of the whole Church.&nbsp; 
This, the King by various artful means, began to do; but he 
recompensed the clergy by allowing them to burn as many people as
they pleased, for holding Luther&rsquo;s opinions.&nbsp; You must
understand that Sir Thomas More, the wise man who had helped the 
King with his book, had been made Chancellor in Wolsey&rsquo;s 
place.&nbsp; But, as he was truly attached to the Church as it 
was even in its abuses, he, in this state of things, 
resigned.</p>
<p>Being now quite resolved to get rid of Queen Catherine, and to
marry Anne Boleyn without more ado, the King made Cranmer 
Archbishop of Canterbury, and directed Queen Catherine to leave 
the Court.&nbsp; She obeyed; but replied that wherever she went, 
she was Queen of England still, and would remain so, to the 
last.&nbsp; The King then married Anne Boleyn privately; and the 
new Archbishop of Canterbury, within half a year, declared his 
marriage with Queen Catherine void, and crowned Anne Boleyn 
Queen.</p>
<p>She might have known that no good could ever come from such 
wrong, and that the corpulent brute who had been so faithless and
so cruel to his first wife, could be more faithless and more 
cruel to his second.&nbsp; She might have known that, even when 
he was in love with her, he had been a mean and selfish coward, 
running away, like a frightened cur, from her society and her 
house, when a dangerous sickness broke out in it, and when she 
might easily have taken it and died, as several of the household 
did.&nbsp; But, Anne Boleyn arrived at all this knowledge too 
late, and bought it at a dear price.&nbsp; Her bad marriage with 
a worse man came to its natural end.&nbsp; Its natural end was 
not, as we shall too soon see, a natural death for her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH</h2>
<h3>PART THE SECOND</h3>
<p>The Pope was thrown into a very angry state of mind when he 
heard of the King&rsquo;s marriage, and fumed exceedingly.&nbsp; 
Many of the English monks and friars, seeing that their order was
in danger, did the same; some even declaimed against the King in 
church before his face, and were not to be stopped until he 
himself roared out &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo;&nbsp; The King, not 
much the worse for this, took it pretty quietly; and was very 
glad when his Queen gave birth to a daughter, who was christened 
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, and declared Princess of 
Wales as her sister Mary had already been.</p>
<p>One of the most atrocious features of this reign was that 
Henry the Eighth was always trimming between the reformed 
religion and the unreformed one; so that the more he quarrelled 
with the Pope, the more of his own subjects he roasted alive for 
not holding the Pope&rsquo;s opinions.&nbsp; Thus, an unfortunate
student named John Frith, and a poor simple tailor named Andrew 
Hewet who loved him very much, and said that whatever John Frith 
believed <i>he</i> believed, were burnt in Smithfield&mdash;to 
show what a capital Christian the King was.</p>
<p>But, these were speedily followed by two much greater victims,
Sir Thomas More, and John Fisher, the Bishop of Rochester.&nbsp; 
The latter, who was a good and amiable old man, had committed no 
greater offence than believing in Elizabeth Barton, called the 
Maid of Kent&mdash;another of those ridiculous women who 
pretended to be inspired, and to make all sorts of heavenly 
revelations, though they indeed uttered nothing but evil 
nonsense.&nbsp; For this offence&mdash;as it was pretended, but 
really for denying the King to be the supreme Head of the 
Church&mdash;he got into trouble, and was put in prison; but, 
even then, he might have been suffered to die naturally (short 
work having been made of executing the Kentish Maid and her 
principal followers), but that the Pope, to spite the King, 
resolved to make him a cardinal.&nbsp; Upon that the King made a 
ferocious joke to the effect that the Pope might send Fisher a 
red hat&mdash;which is the way they make a cardinal&mdash;but he 
should have no head on which to wear it; and he was tried with 
all unfairness and injustice, and sentenced to death.&nbsp; He 
died like a noble and virtuous old man, and left a worthy name 
behind him.&nbsp; The King supposed, I dare say, that Sir Thomas 
More would be frightened by this example; but, as he was not to 
be easily terrified, and, thoroughly believing in the Pope, had 
made up his mind that the King was not the rightful Head of the 
Church, he positively refused to say that he was.&nbsp; For this 
crime he too was tried and sentenced, after having been in prison
a whole year.&nbsp; When he was doomed to death, and came away 
from his trial with the edge of the executioner&rsquo;s axe 
turned towards him&mdash;as was always done in those times when a
state prisoner came to that hopeless pass&mdash;he bore it quite 
serenely, and gave his blessing to his son, who pressed through 
the crowd in Westminster Hall and kneeled down to receive 
it.&nbsp; But, when he got to the Tower Wharf on his way back to 
his prison, and his favourite daughter, <span 
class="smcap">Margaret Roper</span>, a very good woman, rushed 
through the guards again and again, to kiss him and to weep upon 
his neck, he was overcome at last.&nbsp; He soon recovered, and 
never more showed any feeling but cheerfulness and courage.&nbsp;
When he was going up the steps of the scaffold to his death, he 
said jokingly to the Lieutenant of the Tower, observing that they
were weak and shook beneath his tread, &lsquo;I pray you, master 
Lieutenant, see me safe up; and, for my coming down, I can shift 
for myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Also he said to the executioner, after 
he had laid his head upon the block, &lsquo;Let me put my beard 
out of the way; for that, at least, has never committed any 
treason.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then his head was struck off at a 
blow.&nbsp; These two executions were worthy of King Henry the 
Eighth.&nbsp; Sir Thomas More was one of the most virtuous men in
his dominions, and the Bishop was one of his oldest and truest 
friends.&nbsp; But to be a friend of that fellow was almost as 
dangerous as to be his wife.</p>
<p>When the news of these two murders got to Rome, the Pope raged
against the murderer more than ever Pope raged since the world 
began, and prepared a Bull, ordering his subjects to take arms 
against him and dethrone him.&nbsp; The King took all possible 
precautions to keep that document out of his dominions, and set 
to work in return to suppress a great number of the English 
monasteries and abbeys.</p>
<p>This destruction was begun by a body of commissioners, of whom
Cromwell (whom the King had taken into great favour) was the 
head; and was carried on through some few years to its entire 
completion.&nbsp; There is no doubt that many of these religious 
establishments were religious in nothing but in name, and were 
crammed with lazy, indolent, and sensual monks.&nbsp; There is no
doubt that they imposed upon the people in every possible way; 
that they had images moved by wires, which they pretended were 
miraculously moved by Heaven; that they had among them a whole 
tun measure full of teeth, all purporting to have come out of the
head of one saint, who must indeed have been a very extraordinary
person with that enormous allowance of grinders; that they had 
bits of coal which they said had fried Saint Lawrence, and bits 
of toe-nails which they said belonged to other famous saints; 
penknives, and boots, and girdles, which they said belonged to 
others; and that all these bits of rubbish were called Relics, 
and adored by the ignorant people.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, 
there is no doubt either, that the King&rsquo;s officers and men 
punished the good monks with the bad; did great injustice; 
demolished many beautiful things and many valuable libraries; 
destroyed numbers of paintings, stained glass windows, fine 
pavements, and carvings; and that the whole court were ravenously
greedy and rapacious for the division of this great spoil among 
them.&nbsp; The King seems to have grown almost mad in the ardour
of this pursuit; for he declared Thomas &agrave; Becket a 
traitor, though he had been dead so many years, and had his body 
dug up out of his grave.&nbsp; He must have been as miraculous as
the monks pretended, if they had told the truth, for he was found
with one head on his shoulders, and they had shown another as his
undoubted and genuine head ever since his death; it had brought 
them vast sums of money, too.&nbsp; The gold and jewels on his 
shrine filled two great chests, and eight men tottered as they 
carried them away.&nbsp; How rich the monasteries were you may 
infer from the fact that, when they were all suppressed, one 
hundred and thirty thousand pounds a year&mdash;in those days an 
immense sum&mdash;came to the Crown.</p>
<p>These things were not done without causing great discontent 
among the people.&nbsp; The monks had been good landlords and 
hospitable entertainers of all travellers, and had been 
accustomed to give away a great deal of corn, and fruit, and 
meat, and other things.&nbsp; In those days it was difficult to 
change goods into money, in consequence of the roads being very 
few and very bad, and the carts, and waggons of the worst 
description; and they must either have given away some of the 
good things they possessed in enormous quantities, or have 
suffered them to spoil and moulder.&nbsp; So, many of the people 
missed what it was more agreeable to get idly than to work for; 
and the monks who were driven out of their homes and wandered 
about encouraged their discontent; and there were, consequently, 
great risings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.&nbsp; These were put
down by terrific executions, from which the monks themselves did 
not escape, and the King went on grunting and growling in his own
fat way, like a Royal pig.</p>
<p>I have told all this story of the religious houses at one 
time, to make it plainer, and to get back to the King&rsquo;s 
domestic affairs.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Queen Catherine was by this time dead; and the
King was by this time as tired of his second Queen as he had been
of his first.&nbsp; As he had fallen in love with Anne when she 
was in the service of Catherine, so he now fell in love with 
another lady in the service of Anne.&nbsp; See how wicked deeds 
are punished, and how bitterly and self-reproachfully the Queen 
must now have thought of her own rise to the throne!&nbsp; The 
new fancy was a <span class="smcap">Lady Jane Seymour</span>; and
the King no sooner set his mind on her, than he resolved to have 
Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; So, he brought a number of 
charges against Anne, accusing her of dreadful crimes which she 
had never committed, and implicating in them her own brother and 
certain gentlemen in her service: among whom one Norris, and Mark
Smeaton a musician, are best remembered.&nbsp; As the lords and 
councillors were as afraid of the King and as subservient to him 
as the meanest peasant in England was, they brought in Anne 
Boleyn guilty, and the other unfortunate persons accused with 
her, guilty too.&nbsp; Those gentlemen died like men, with the 
exception of Smeaton, who had been tempted by the King into 
telling lies, which he called confessions, and who had expected 
to be pardoned; but who, I am very glad to say, was not.&nbsp; 
There was then only the Queen to dispose of.&nbsp; She had been 
surrounded in the Tower with women spies; had been monstrously 
persecuted and foully slandered; and had received no 
justice.&nbsp; But her spirit rose with her afflictions; and, 
after having in vain tried to soften the King by writing an 
affecting letter to him which still exists, &lsquo;from her 
doleful prison in the Tower,&rsquo; she resigned herself to 
death.&nbsp; She said to those about her, very cheerfully, that 
she had heard say the executioner was a good one, and that she 
had a little neck (she laughed and clasped it with her hands as 
she said that), and would soon be out of her pain.&nbsp; And she 
<i>was</i> soon out of her pain, poor creature, on the Green 
inside the Tower, and her body was flung into an old box and put 
away in the ground under the chapel.</p>
<p>There is a story that the King sat in his palace listening 
very anxiously for the sound of the cannon which was to announce 
this new murder; and that, when he heard it come booming on the 
air, he rose up in great spirits and ordered out his dogs to go 
a-hunting.&nbsp; He was bad enough to do it; but whether he did 
it or not, it is certain that he married Jane Seymour the very 
next day.</p>
<p>I have not much pleasure in recording that she lived just long
enough to give birth to a son who was christened <span 
class="smcap">Edward</span>, and then to die of a fever: for, I 
cannot but think that any woman who married such a ruffian, and 
knew what innocent blood was on his hands, deserved the axe that 
would assuredly have fallen on the neck of Jane Seymour, if she 
had lived much longer.</p>
<p>Cranmer had done what he could to save some of the Church 
property for purposes of religion and education; but, the great 
families had been so hungry to get hold of it, that very little 
could be rescued for such objects.&nbsp; Even <span 
class="smcap">Miles Coverdale</span>, who did the people the 
inestimable service of translating the Bible into English (which 
the unreformed religion never permitted to be done), was left in 
poverty while the great families clutched the Church lands and 
money.&nbsp; The people had been told that when the Crown came 
into possession of these funds, it would not be necessary to tax 
them; but they were taxed afresh directly afterwards.&nbsp; It 
was fortunate for them, indeed, that so many nobles were so 
greedy for this wealth; since, if it had remained with the Crown,
there might have been no end to tyranny for hundreds of 
years.&nbsp; One of the most active writers on the Church&rsquo;s
side against the King was a member of his own family&mdash;a sort
of distant cousin, <span class="smcap">Reginald Pole</span> by 
name&mdash;who attacked him in the most violent manner (though he
received a pension from him all the time), and fought for the 
Church with his pen, day and night.&nbsp; As he was beyond the 
King&rsquo;s reach&mdash;being in Italy&mdash;the King politely 
invited him over to discuss the subject; but he, knowing better 
than to come, and wisely staying where he was, the King&rsquo;s 
rage fell upon his brother Lord Montague, the Marquis of Exeter, 
and some other gentlemen: who were tried for high treason in 
corresponding with him and aiding him&mdash;which they probably 
did&mdash;and were all executed.&nbsp; The Pope made Reginald 
Pole a cardinal; but, so much against his will, that it is 
thought he even aspired in his own mind to the vacant throne of 
England, and had hopes of marrying the Princess Mary.&nbsp; His 
being made a high priest, however, put an end to all that.&nbsp; 
His mother, the venerable Countess of Salisbury&mdash;who was, 
unfortunately for herself, within the tyrant&rsquo;s 
reach&mdash;was the last of his relatives on whom his wrath 
fell.&nbsp; When she was told to lay her grey head upon the 
block, she answered the executioner, &lsquo;No!&nbsp; My head 
never committed treason, and if you want it, you shall seize 
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; So, she ran round and round the scaffold with 
the executioner striking at her, and her grey hair bedabbled with
blood; and even when they held her down upon the block she moved 
her head about to the last, resolved to be no party to her own 
barbarous murder.&nbsp; All this the people bore, as they had 
borne everything else.</p>
<p>Indeed they bore much more; for the slow fires of Smithfield 
were continually burning, and people were constantly being 
roasted to death&mdash;still to show what a good Christian the 
King was.&nbsp; He defied the Pope and his Bull, which was now 
issued, and had come into England; but he burned innumerable 
people whose only offence was that they differed from the 
Pope&rsquo;s religious opinions.&nbsp; There was a wretched man 
named <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>, among others, who was 
tried for this before the King, and with whom six bishops argued 
one after another.&nbsp; When he was quite exhausted (as well he 
might be, after six bishops), he threw himself on the 
King&rsquo;s mercy; but the King blustered out that he had no 
mercy for heretics.&nbsp; So, <i>he</i> too fed the fire.</p>
<p>All this the people bore, and more than all this yet.&nbsp; 
The national spirit seems to have been banished from the kingdom 
at this time.&nbsp; The very people who were executed for 
treason, the very wives and friends of the &lsquo;bluff&rsquo; 
King, spoke of him on the scaffold as a good prince, and a gentle
prince&mdash;just as serfs in similar circumstances have been 
known to do, under the Sultan and Bashaws of the East, or under 
the fierce old tyrants of Russia, who poured boiling and freezing
water on them alternately, until they died.&nbsp; The Parliament 
were as bad as the rest, and gave the King whatever he wanted; 
among other vile accommodations, they gave him new powers of 
murdering, at his will and pleasure, any one whom he might choose
to call a traitor.&nbsp; But the worst measure they passed was an
Act of Six Articles, commonly called at the time &lsquo;the whip 
with six strings;&rsquo; which punished offences against the 
Pope&rsquo;s opinions, without mercy, and enforced the very worst
parts of the monkish religion.&nbsp; Cranmer would have modified 
it, if he could; but, being overborne by the Romish party, had 
not the power.&nbsp; As one of the articles declared that priests
should not marry, and as he was married himself, he sent his wife
and children into Germany, and began to tremble at his danger; 
none the less because he was, and had long been, the King&rsquo;s
friend.&nbsp; This whip of six strings was made under the 
King&rsquo;s own eye.&nbsp; It should never be forgotten of him 
how cruelly he supported the worst of the Popish doctrines when 
there was nothing to be got by opposing them.</p>
<p>This amiable monarch now thought of taking another wife.&nbsp;
He proposed to the French King to have some of the ladies of the 
French Court exhibited before him, that he might make his Royal 
choice; but the French King answered that he would rather not 
have his ladies trotted out to be shown like horses at a 
fair.&nbsp; He proposed to the Dowager Duchess of Milan, who 
replied that she might have thought of such a match if she had 
had two heads; but, that only owning one, she must beg to keep it
safe.&nbsp; At last Cromwell represented that there was a 
Protestant Princess in Germany&mdash;those who held the reformed 
religion were called Protestants, because their leaders had 
Protested against the abuses and impositions of the unreformed 
Church&mdash;named <span class="smcap">Anne of Cleves</span>, who
was beautiful, and would answer the purpose admirably.&nbsp; The 
King said was she a large woman, because he must have a fat 
wife?&nbsp; &lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Cromwell; &lsquo;she was 
very large, just the thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; On hearing this the King
sent over his famous painter, Hans Holbein, to take her 
portrait.&nbsp; Hans made her out to be so good-looking that the 
King was satisfied, and the marriage was arranged.&nbsp; But, 
whether anybody had paid Hans to touch up the picture; or whether
Hans, like one or two other painters, flattered a princess in the
ordinary way of business, I cannot say: all I know is, that when 
Anne came over and the King went to Rochester to meet her, and 
first saw her without her seeing him, he swore she was &lsquo;a 
great Flanders mare,&rsquo; and said he would never marry 
her.&nbsp; Being obliged to do it now matters had gone so far, he
would not give her the presents he had prepared, and would never 
notice her.&nbsp; He never forgave Cromwell his part in the 
affair.&nbsp; His downfall dates from that time.</p>
<p>It was quickened by his enemies, in the interests of the 
unreformed religion, putting in the King&rsquo;s way, at a state 
dinner, a niece of the Duke of Norfolk, <span 
class="smcap">Catherine Howard</span>, a young lady of 
fascinating manners, though small in stature and not particularly
beautiful.&nbsp; Falling in love with her on the spot, the King 
soon divorced Anne of Cleves after making her the subject of much
brutal talk, on pretence that she had been previously betrothed 
to some one else&mdash;which would never do for one of his 
dignity&mdash;and married Catherine.&nbsp; It is probable that on
his wedding day, of all days in the year, he sent his faithful 
Cromwell to the scaffold, and had his head struck off.&nbsp; He 
further celebrated the occasion by burning at one time, and 
causing to be drawn to the fire on the same hurdles, some 
Protestant prisoners for denying the Pope&rsquo;s doctrines, and 
some Roman Catholic prisoners for denying his own 
supremacy.&nbsp; Still the people bore it, and not a gentleman in
England raised his hand.</p>
<p>But, by a just retribution, it soon came out that Catherine 
Howard, before her marriage, had been really guilty of such 
crimes as the King had falsely attributed to his second wife Anne
Boleyn; so, again the dreadful axe made the King a widower, and 
this Queen passed away as so many in that reign had passed away 
before her.&nbsp; As an appropriate pursuit under the 
circumstances, Henry then applied himself to superintending the 
composition of a religious book called &lsquo;A necessary 
doctrine for any Christian Man.&rsquo;&nbsp; He must have been a 
little confused in his mind, I think, at about this period; for 
he was so false to himself as to be true to some one: that some 
one being Cranmer, whom the Duke of Norfolk and others of his 
enemies tried to ruin; but to whom the King was steadfast, and to
whom he one night gave his ring, charging him when he should find
himself, next day, accused of treason, to show it to the council 
board.&nbsp; This Cranmer did to the confusion of his 
enemies.&nbsp; I suppose the King thought he might want him a 
little longer.</p>
<p>He married yet once more.&nbsp; Yes, strange to say, he found 
in England another woman who would become his wife, and she was 
<span class="smcap">Catherine Parr</span>, widow of Lord 
Latimer.&nbsp; She leaned towards the reformed religion; and it 
is some comfort to know, that she tormented the King considerably
by arguing a variety of doctrinal points with him on all possible
occasions.&nbsp; She had very nearly done this to her own 
destruction.&nbsp; After one of these conversations the King in a
very black mood actually instructed <span 
class="smcap">Gardiner</span>, one of his Bishops who favoured 
the Popish opinions, to draw a bill of accusation against her, 
which would have inevitably brought her to the scaffold where her
predecessors had died, but that one of her friends picked up the 
paper of instructions which had been dropped in the palace, and 
gave her timely notice.&nbsp; She fell ill with terror; but 
managed the King so well when he came to entrap her into further 
statements&mdash;by saying that she had only spoken on such 
points to divert his mind and to get some information from his 
extraordinary wisdom&mdash;that he gave her a kiss and called her
his sweetheart.&nbsp; And, when the Chancellor came next day 
actually to take her to the Tower, the King sent him about his 
business, and honoured him with the epithets of a beast, a knave,
and a fool.&nbsp; So near was Catherine Parr to the block, and so
narrow was her escape!</p>
<p>There was war with Scotland in this reign, and a short clumsy 
war with France for favouring Scotland; but, the events at home 
were so dreadful, and leave such an enduring stain on the 
country, that I need say no more of what happened abroad.</p>
<p>A few more horrors, and this reign is over.&nbsp; There was a 
lady, <span class="smcap">Anne Askew</span>, in Lincolnshire, who
inclined to the Protestant opinions, and whose husband being a 
fierce Catholic, turned her out of his house.&nbsp; She came to 
London, and was considered as offending against the six articles,
and was taken to the Tower, and put upon the rack&mdash;probably 
because it was hoped that she might, in her agony, criminate some
obnoxious persons; if falsely, so much the better.&nbsp; She was 
tortured without uttering a cry, until the Lieutenant of the 
Tower would suffer his men to torture her no more; and then two 
priests who were present actually pulled off their robes, and 
turned the wheels of the rack with their own hands, so rending 
and twisting and breaking her that she was afterwards carried to 
the fire in a chair.&nbsp; She was burned with three others, a 
gentleman, a clergyman, and a tailor; and so the world went 
on.</p>
<p>Either the King became afraid of the power of the Duke of 
Norfolk, and his son the Earl of Surrey, or they gave him some 
offence, but he resolved to pull <i>them</i> down, to follow all 
the rest who were gone.&nbsp; The son was tried first&mdash;of 
course for nothing&mdash;and defended himself bravely; but of 
course he was found guilty, and of course he was executed.&nbsp; 
Then his father was laid hold of, and left for death too.</p>
<p>But the King himself was left for death by a Greater King, and
the earth was to be rid of him at last.&nbsp; He was now a 
swollen, hideous spectacle, with a great hole in his leg, and so 
odious to every sense that it was dreadful to approach him.&nbsp;
When he was found to be dying, Cranmer was sent for from his 
palace at Croydon, and came with all speed, but found him 
speechless.&nbsp; Happily, in that hour he perished.&nbsp; He was
in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and the thirty-eighth of his 
reign.</p>
<p>Henry the Eighth has been favoured by some Protestant writers,
because the Reformation was achieved in his time.&nbsp; But the 
mighty merit of it lies with other men and not with him; and it 
can be rendered none the worse by this monster&rsquo;s crimes, 
and none the better by any defence of them.&nbsp; The plain truth
is, that he was a most intolerable ruffian, a disgrace to human 
nature, and a blot of blood and grease upon the History of 
England.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SIXTH</h2>
<p>Henry the Eighth had made a will, appointing a council of 
sixteen to govern the kingdom for his son while he was under age 
(he was now only ten years old), and another council of twelve to
help them.&nbsp; The most powerful of the first council was the 
<span class="smcap">Earl of Hertford</span>, the young 
King&rsquo;s uncle, who lost no time in bringing his nephew with 
great state up to Enfield, and thence to the Tower.&nbsp; It was 
considered at the time a striking proof of virtue in the young 
King that he was sorry for his father&rsquo;s death; but, as 
common subjects have that virtue too, sometimes, we will say no 
more about it.</p>
<p>There was a curious part of the late King&rsquo;s will, 
requiring his executors to fulfil whatever promises he had 
made.&nbsp; Some of the court wondering what these might be, the 
Earl of Hertford and the other noblemen interested, said that 
they were promises to advance and enrich <i>them</i>.&nbsp; So, 
the Earl of Hertford made himself <span class="smcap">Duke of 
Somerset</span>, and made his brother <span class="smcap">Edward 
Seymour</span> a baron; and there were various similar 
promotions, all very agreeable to the parties concerned, and very
dutiful, no doubt, to the late King&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; To be 
more dutiful still, they made themselves rich out of the Church 
lands, and were very comfortable.&nbsp; The new Duke of Somerset 
caused himself to be declared <span 
class="smcap">Protector</span> of the kingdom, and was, indeed, 
the King.</p>
<p>As young Edward the Sixth had been brought up in the 
principles of the Protestant religion, everybody knew that they 
would be maintained.&nbsp; But Cranmer, to whom they were chiefly
entrusted, advanced them steadily and temperately.&nbsp; Many 
superstitious and ridiculous practices were stopped; but 
practices which were harmless were not interfered with.</p>
<p>The Duke of Somerset, the Protector, was anxious to have the 
young King engaged in marriage to the young Queen of Scotland, in
order to prevent that princess from making an alliance with any 
foreign power; but, as a large party in Scotland were 
unfavourable to this plan, he invaded that country.&nbsp; His 
excuse for doing so was, that the Border men&mdash;that is, the 
Scotch who lived in that part of the country where England and 
Scotland joined&mdash;troubled the English very much.&nbsp; But 
there were two sides to this question; for the English Border men
troubled the Scotch too; and, through many long years, there were
perpetual border quarrels which gave rise to numbers of old tales
and songs.&nbsp; However, the Protector invaded Scotland; and 
<span class="smcap">Arran</span>, the Scottish Regent, with an 
army twice as large as his, advanced to meet him.&nbsp; They 
encountered on the banks of the river Esk, within a few miles of 
Edinburgh; and there, after a little skirmish, the Protector made
such moderate proposals, in offering to retire if the Scotch 
would only engage not to marry their princess to any foreign 
prince, that the Regent thought the English were afraid.&nbsp; 
But in this he made a horrible mistake; for the English soldiers 
on land, and the English sailors on the water, so set upon the 
Scotch, that they broke and fled, and more than ten thousand of 
them were killed.&nbsp; It was a dreadful battle, for the 
fugitives were slain without mercy.&nbsp; The ground for four 
miles, all the way to Edinburgh, was strewn with dead men, and 
with arms, and legs, and heads.&nbsp; Some hid themselves in 
streams and were drowned; some threw away their armour and were 
killed running, almost naked; but in this battle of Pinkey the 
English lost only two or three hundred men.&nbsp; They were much 
better clothed than the Scotch; at the poverty of whose 
appearance and country they were exceedingly astonished.</p>
<p>A Parliament was called when Somerset came back, and it 
repealed the whip with six strings, and did one or two other good
things; though it unhappily retained the punishment of burning 
for those people who did not make believe to believe, in all 
religious matters, what the Government had declared that they 
must and should believe.&nbsp; It also made a foolish law (meant 
to put down beggars), that any man who lived idly and loitered 
about for three days together, should be burned with a hot iron, 
made a slave, and wear an iron fetter.&nbsp; But this savage 
absurdity soon came to an end, and went the way of a great many 
other foolish laws.</p>
<p>The Protector was now so proud that he sat in Parliament 
before all the nobles, on the right hand of the throne.&nbsp; 
Many other noblemen, who only wanted to be as proud if they could
get a chance, became his enemies of course; and it is supposed 
that he came back suddenly from Scotland because he had received 
news that his brother, <span class="smcap">Lord Seymour</span>, 
was becoming dangerous to him.&nbsp; This lord was now High 
Admiral of England; a very handsome man, and a great favourite 
with the Court ladies&mdash;even with the young Princess 
Elizabeth, who romped with him a little more than young 
princesses in these times do with any one.&nbsp; He had married 
Catherine Parr, the late King&rsquo;s widow, who was now dead; 
and, to strengthen his power, he secretly supplied the young King
with money.&nbsp; He may even have engaged with some of his 
brother&rsquo;s enemies in a plot to carry the boy off.&nbsp; On 
these and other accusations, at any rate, he was confined in the 
Tower, impeached, and found guilty; his own brother&rsquo;s name 
being&mdash;unnatural and sad to tell&mdash;the first signed to 
the warrant of his execution.&nbsp; He was executed on Tower 
Hill, and died denying his treason.&nbsp; One of his last 
proceedings in this world was to write two letters, one to the 
Princess Elizabeth, and one to the Princess Mary, which a servant
of his took charge of, and concealed in his shoe.&nbsp; These 
letters are supposed to have urged them against his brother, and 
to revenge his death.&nbsp; What they truly contained is not 
known; but there is no doubt that he had, at one time, obtained 
great influence over the Princess Elizabeth.</p>
<p>All this while, the Protestant religion was making 
progress.&nbsp; The images which the people had gradually come to
worship, were removed from the churches; the people were informed
that they need not confess themselves to priests unless they 
chose; a common prayer-book was drawn up in the English language,
which all could understand, and many other improvements were 
made; still moderately.&nbsp; For Cranmer was a very moderate 
man, and even restrained the Protestant clergy from violently 
abusing the unreformed religion&mdash;as they very often did, and
which was not a good example.&nbsp; But the people were at this 
time in great distress.&nbsp; The rapacious nobility who had come
into possession of the Church lands, were very bad 
landlords.&nbsp; They enclosed great quantities of ground for the
feeding of sheep, which was then more profitable than the growing
of crops; and this increased the general distress.&nbsp; So the 
people, who still understood little of what was going on about 
them, and still readily believed what the homeless monks told 
them&mdash;many of whom had been their good friends in their 
better days&mdash;took it into their heads that all this was 
owing to the reformed religion, and therefore rose, in many parts
of the country.</p>
<p>The most powerful risings were in Devonshire and 
Norfolk.&nbsp; In Devonshire, the rebellion was so strong that 
ten thousand men united within a few days, and even laid siege to
Exeter.&nbsp; But <span class="smcap">Lord Russell</span>, coming
to the assistance of the citizens who defended that town, 
defeated the rebels; and, not only hanged the Mayor of one place,
but hanged the vicar of another from his own church 
steeple.&nbsp; What with hanging and killing by the sword, four 
thousand of the rebels are supposed to have fallen in that one 
county.&nbsp; In Norfolk (where the rising was more against the 
enclosure of open lands than against the reformed religion), the 
popular leader was a man named <span class="smcap">Robert 
Ket</span>, a tanner of Wymondham.&nbsp; The mob were, in the 
first instance, excited against the tanner by one <span 
class="smcap">John Flowerdew</span>, a gentleman who owed him a 
grudge: but the tanner was more than a match for the gentleman, 
since he soon got the people on his side, and established himself
near Norwich with quite an army.&nbsp; There was a large oak-tree
in that place, on a spot called Moushold Hill, which Ket named 
the Tree of Reformation; and under its green boughs, he and his 
men sat, in the midsummer weather, holding courts of justice, and
debating affairs of state.&nbsp; They were even impartial enough 
to allow some rather tiresome public speakers to get up into this
Tree of Reformation, and point out their errors to them, in long 
discourses, while they lay listening (not always without some 
grumbling and growling) in the shade below.&nbsp; At last, one 
sunny July day, a herald appeared below the tree, and proclaimed 
Ket and all his men traitors, unless from that moment they 
dispersed and went home: in which case they were to receive a 
pardon.&nbsp; But, Ket and his men made light of the herald and 
became stronger than ever, until the Earl of Warwick went after 
them with a sufficient force, and cut them all to pieces.&nbsp; A
few were hanged, drawn, and quartered, as traitors, and their 
limbs were sent into various country places to be a terror to the
people.&nbsp; Nine of them were hanged upon nine green branches 
of the Oak of Reformation; and so, for the time, that tree may be
said to have withered away.</p>
<p>The Protector, though a haughty man, had compassion for the 
real distresses of the common people, and a sincere desire to 
help them.&nbsp; But he was too proud and too high in degree to 
hold even their favour steadily; and many of the nobles always 
envied and hated him, because they were as proud and not as high 
as he.&nbsp; He was at this time building a great Palace in the 
Strand: to get the stone for which he blew up church steeples 
with gunpowder, and pulled down bishops&rsquo; houses: thus 
making himself still more disliked.&nbsp; At length, his 
principal enemy, the Earl of Warwick&mdash;Dudley by name, and 
the son of that Dudley who had made himself so odious with 
Empson, in the reign of Henry the Seventh&mdash;joined with seven
other members of the Council against him, formed a separate 
Council; and, becoming stronger in a few days, sent him to the 
Tower under twenty-nine articles of accusation.&nbsp; After being
sentenced by the Council to the forfeiture of all his offices and
lands, he was liberated and pardoned, on making a very humble 
submission.&nbsp; He was even taken back into the Council again, 
after having suffered this fall, and married his daughter, <span 
class="smcap">Lady Anne Seymour</span>, to Warwick&rsquo;s eldest
son.&nbsp; But such a reconciliation was little likely to last, 
and did not outlive a year.&nbsp; Warwick, having got himself 
made Duke of Northumberland, and having advanced the more 
important of his friends, then finished the history by causing 
the Duke of Somerset and his friend <span class="smcap">Lord 
Grey</span>, and others, to be arrested for treason, in having 
conspired to seize and dethrone the King.&nbsp; They were also 
accused of having intended to seize the new Duke of 
Northumberland, with his friends <span class="smcap">Lord 
Northampton</span> and <span class="smcap">Lord Pembroke</span>; 
to murder them if they found need; and to raise the City to 
revolt.&nbsp; All this the fallen Protector positively denied; 
except that he confessed to having spoken of the murder of those 
three noblemen, but having never designed it.&nbsp; He was 
acquitted of the charge of treason, and found guilty of the other
charges; so when the people&mdash;who remembered his having been 
their friend, now that he was disgraced and in danger, saw him 
come out from his trial with the axe turned from him&mdash;they 
thought he was altogether acquitted, and sent up a loud shout of 
joy.</p>
<p>But the Duke of Somerset was ordered to be beheaded on Tower 
Hill, at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and proclamations 
were issued bidding the citizens keep at home until after 
ten.&nbsp; They filled the streets, however, and crowded the 
place of execution as soon as it was light; and, with sad faces 
and sad hearts, saw the once powerful Protector ascend the 
scaffold to lay his head upon the dreadful block.&nbsp; While he 
was yet saying his last words to them with manly courage, and 
telling them, in particular, how it comforted him, at that pass, 
to have assisted in reforming the national religion, a member of 
the Council was seen riding up on horseback.&nbsp; They again 
thought that the Duke was saved by his bringing a reprieve, and 
again shouted for joy.&nbsp; But the Duke himself told them they 
were mistaken, and laid down his head and had it struck off at a 
blow.</p>
<p>Many of the bystanders rushed forward and steeped their 
handkerchiefs in his blood, as a mark of their affection.&nbsp; 
He had, indeed, been capable of many good acts, and one of them 
was discovered after he was no more.&nbsp; The Bishop of Durham, 
a very good man, had been informed against to the Council, when 
the Duke was in power, as having answered a treacherous letter 
proposing a rebellion against the reformed religion.&nbsp; As the
answer could not be found, he could not be declared guilty; but 
it was now discovered, hidden by the Duke himself among some 
private papers, in his regard for that good man.&nbsp; The Bishop
lost his office, and was deprived of his possessions.</p>
<p>It is not very pleasant to know that while his uncle lay in 
prison under sentence of death, the young King was being vastly 
entertained by plays, and dances, and sham fights: but there is 
no doubt of it, for he kept a journal himself.&nbsp; It is 
pleasanter to know that not a single Roman Catholic was burnt in 
this reign for holding that religion; though two wretched victims
suffered for heresy.&nbsp; One, a woman named <span 
class="smcap">Joan Bocher</span>, for professing some opinions 
that even she could only explain in unintelligible jargon.&nbsp; 
The other, a Dutchman, named <span class="smcap">Von 
Paris</span>, who practised as a surgeon in London.&nbsp; Edward 
was, to his credit, exceedingly unwilling to sign the warrant for
the woman&rsquo;s execution: shedding tears before he did so, and
telling Cranmer, who urged him to do it (though Cranmer really 
would have spared the woman at first, but for her own determined 
obstinacy), that the guilt was not his, but that of the man who 
so strongly urged the dreadful act.&nbsp; We shall see, too soon,
whether the time ever came when Cranmer is likely to have 
remembered this with sorrow and remorse.</p>
<p>Cranmer and <span class="smcap">Ridley</span> (at first Bishop
of Rochester, and afterwards Bishop of London) were the most 
powerful of the clergy of this reign.&nbsp; Others were 
imprisoned and deprived of their property for still adhering to 
the unreformed religion; the most important among whom were <span
class="smcap">Gardiner</span> Bishop of Winchester, <span 
class="smcap">Heath</span> Bishop of Worcester, <span 
class="smcap">Day</span> Bishop of Chichester, and <span 
class="smcap">Bonner</span> that Bishop of London who was 
superseded by Ridley.&nbsp; The Princess Mary, who inherited her 
mother&rsquo;s gloomy temper, and hated the reformed religion as 
connected with her mother&rsquo;s wrongs and sorrows&mdash;she 
knew nothing else about it, always refusing to read a single book
in which it was truly described&mdash;held by the unreformed 
religion too, and was the only person in the kingdom for whom the
old Mass was allowed to be performed; nor would the young King 
have made that exception even in her favour, but for the strong 
persuasions of Cranmer and Ridley.&nbsp; He always viewed it with
horror; and when he fell into a sickly condition, after having 
been very ill, first of the measles and then of the small-pox, he
was greatly troubled in mind to think that if he died, and she, 
the next heir to the throne, succeeded, the Roman Catholic 
religion would be set up again.</p>
<p>This uneasiness, the Duke of Northumberland was not slow to 
encourage: for, if the Princess Mary came to the throne, he, who 
had taken part with the Protestants, was sure to be 
disgraced.&nbsp; Now, the Duchess of Suffolk was descended from 
King Henry the Seventh; and, if she resigned what little or no 
right she had, in favour of her daughter <span class="smcap">Lady
Jane Grey</span>, that would be the succession to promote the 
Duke&rsquo;s greatness; because <span class="smcap">Lord Guilford
Dudley</span>, one of his sons, was, at this very time, newly 
married to her.&nbsp; So, he worked upon the King&rsquo;s fears, 
and persuaded him to set aside both the Princess Mary and the 
Princess Elizabeth, and assert his right to appoint his 
successor.&nbsp; Accordingly the young King handed to the Crown 
lawyers a writing signed half a dozen times over by himself, 
appointing Lady Jane Grey to succeed to the Crown, and requiring 
them to have his will made out according to law.&nbsp; They were 
much against it at first, and told the King so; but the Duke of 
Northumberland&mdash;being so violent about it that the lawyers 
even expected him to beat them, and hotly declaring that, 
stripped to his shirt, he would fight any man in such a 
quarrel&mdash;they yielded.&nbsp; Cranmer, also, at first 
hesitated; pleading that he had sworn to maintain the succession 
of the Crown to the Princess Mary; but, he was a weak man in his 
resolutions, and afterwards signed the document with the rest of 
the council.</p>
<p>It was completed none too soon; for Edward was now sinking in 
a rapid decline; and, by way of making him better, they handed 
him over to a woman-doctor who pretended to be able to cure 
it.&nbsp; He speedily got worse.&nbsp; On the sixth of July, in 
the year one thousand five hundred and fifty-three, he died, very
peaceably and piously, praying God, with his last breath, to 
protect the reformed religion.</p>
<p>This King died in the sixteenth year of his age, and in the 
seventh of his reign.&nbsp; It is difficult to judge what the 
character of one so young might afterwards have become among so 
many bad, ambitious, quarrelling nobles.&nbsp; But, he was an 
amiable boy, of very good abilities, and had nothing coarse or 
cruel or brutal in his disposition&mdash;which in the son of such
a father is rather surprising.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER MARY</h2>
<p>The Duke of Northumberland was very anxious to keep the young 
King&rsquo;s death a secret, in order that he might get the two 
Princesses into his power.&nbsp; But, the Princess Mary, being 
informed of that event as she was on her way to London to see her
sick brother, turned her horse&rsquo;s head, and rode away into 
Norfolk.&nbsp; The Earl of Arundel was her friend, and it was he 
who sent her warning of what had happened.</p>
<p>As the secret could not be kept, the Duke of Northumberland 
and the council sent for the Lord Mayor of London and some of the
aldermen, and made a merit of telling it to them.&nbsp; Then, 
they made it known to the people, and set off to inform Lady Jane
Grey that she was to be Queen.</p>
<p>She was a pretty girl of only sixteen, and was amiable, 
learned, and clever.&nbsp; When the lords who came to her, fell 
on their knees before her, and told her what tidings they 
brought, she was so astonished that she fainted.&nbsp; On 
recovering, she expressed her sorrow for the young King&rsquo;s 
death, and said that she knew she was unfit to govern the 
kingdom; but that if she must be Queen, she prayed God to direct 
her.&nbsp; She was then at Sion House, near Brentford; and the 
lords took her down the river in state to the Tower, that she 
might remain there (as the custom was) until she was 
crowned.&nbsp; But the people were not at all favourable to Lady 
Jane, considering that the right to be Queen was Mary&rsquo;s, 
and greatly disliking the Duke of Northumberland.&nbsp; They were
not put into a better humour by the Duke&rsquo;s causing a 
vintner&rsquo;s servant, one Gabriel Pot, to be taken up for 
expressing his dissatisfaction among the crowd, and to have his 
ears nailed to the pillory, and cut off.&nbsp; Some powerful men 
among the nobility declared on Mary&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; They 
raised troops to support her cause, had her proclaimed Queen at 
Norwich, and gathered around her at the castle of Framlingham, 
which belonged to the Duke of Norfolk.&nbsp; For, she was not 
considered so safe as yet, but that it was best to keep her in a 
castle on the sea-coast, from whence she might be sent abroad, if
necessary.</p>
<p>The Council would have despatched Lady Jane&rsquo;s father, 
the Duke of Suffolk, as the general of the army against this 
force; but, as Lady Jane implored that her father might remain 
with her, and as he was known to be but a weak man, they told the
Duke of Northumberland that he must take the command 
himself.&nbsp; He was not very ready to do so, as he mistrusted 
the Council much; but there was no help for it, and he set forth 
with a heavy heart, observing to a lord who rode beside him 
through Shoreditch at the head of the troops, that, although the 
people pressed in great numbers to look at them, they were 
terribly silent.</p>
<p>And his fears for himself turned out to be well founded.&nbsp;
While he was waiting at Cambridge for further help from the 
Council, the Council took it into their heads to turn their backs
on Lady Jane&rsquo;s cause, and to take up the Princess 
Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This was chiefly owing to the 
before-mentioned Earl of Arundel, who represented to the Lord 
Mayor and aldermen, in a second interview with those sagacious 
persons, that, as for himself, he did not perceive the Reformed 
religion to be in much danger&mdash;which Lord Pembroke backed by
flourishing his sword as another kind of persuasion.&nbsp; The 
Lord Mayor and aldermen, thus enlightened, said there could be no
doubt that the Princess Mary ought to be Queen.&nbsp; So, she was
proclaimed at the Cross by St. Paul&rsquo;s, and barrels of wine 
were given to the people, and they got very drunk, and danced 
round blazing bonfires&mdash;little thinking, poor wretches, what
other bonfires would soon be blazing in Queen Mary&rsquo;s 
name.</p>
<p>After a ten days&rsquo; dream of royalty, Lady Jane Grey 
resigned the Crown with great willingness, saying that she had 
only accepted it in obedience to her father and mother; and went 
gladly back to her pleasant house by the river, and her 
books.&nbsp; Mary then came on towards London; and at Wanstead in
Essex, was joined by her half-sister, the Princess 
Elizabeth.&nbsp; They passed through the streets of London to the
Tower, and there the new Queen met some eminent prisoners then 
confined in it, kissed them, and gave them their liberty.&nbsp; 
Among these was that Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, who had been
imprisoned in the last reign for holding to the unreformed 
religion.&nbsp; Him she soon made chancellor.</p>
<p>The Duke of Northumberland had been taken prisoner, and, 
together with his son and five others, was quickly brought before
the Council.&nbsp; He, not unnaturally, asked that Council, in 
his defence, whether it was treason to obey orders that had been 
issued under the great seal; and, if it were, whether they, who 
had obeyed them too, ought to be his judges?&nbsp; But they made 
light of these points; and, being resolved to have him out of the
way, soon sentenced him to death.&nbsp; He had risen into power 
upon the death of another man, and made but a poor show (as might
be expected) when he himself lay low.&nbsp; He entreated Gardiner
to let him live, if it were only in a mouse&rsquo;s hole; and, 
when he ascended the scaffold to be beheaded on Tower Hill, 
addressed the people in a miserable way, saying that he had been 
incited by others, and exhorting them to return to the unreformed
religion, which he told them was his faith.&nbsp; There seems 
reason to suppose that he expected a pardon even then, in return 
for this confession; but it matters little whether he did or 
not.&nbsp; His head was struck off.</p>
<p>Mary was now crowned Queen.&nbsp; She was thirty-seven years 
of age, short and thin, wrinkled in the face, and very 
unhealthy.&nbsp; But she had a great liking for show and for 
bright colours, and all the ladies of her Court were 
magnificently dressed.&nbsp; She had a great liking too for old 
customs, without much sense in them; and she was oiled in the 
oldest way, and blessed in the oldest way, and done all manner of
things to in the oldest way, at her coronation.&nbsp; I hope they
did her good.</p>
<p>She soon began to show her desire to put down the Reformed 
religion, and put up the unreformed one: though it was dangerous 
work as yet, the people being something wiser than they used to 
be.&nbsp; They even cast a shower of stones&mdash;and among them 
a dagger&mdash;at one of the royal chaplains who attacked the 
Reformed religion in a public sermon.&nbsp; But the Queen and her
priests went steadily on.&nbsp; Ridley, the powerful bishop of 
the last reign, was seized and sent to the Tower.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Latimer</span>, also celebrated among the Clergy of
the last reign, was likewise sent to the Tower, and Cranmer 
speedily followed.&nbsp; Latimer was an aged man; and, as his 
guards took him through Smithfield, he looked round it, and said,
&lsquo;This is a place that hath long groaned for 
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; For he knew well, what kind of bonfires would 
soon be burning.&nbsp; Nor was the knowledge confined to 
him.&nbsp; The prisons were fast filled with the chief 
Protestants, who were there left rotting in darkness, hunger, 
dirt, and separation from their friends; many, who had time left 
them for escape, fled from the kingdom; and the dullest of the 
people began, now, to see what was coming.</p>
<p>It came on fast.&nbsp; A Parliament was got together; not 
without strong suspicion of unfairness; and they annulled the 
divorce, formerly pronounced by Cranmer between the Queen&rsquo;s
mother and King Henry the Eighth, and unmade all the laws on the 
subject of religion that had been made in the last King 
Edward&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; They began their proceedings, in 
violation of the law, by having the old mass said before them in 
Latin, and by turning out a bishop who would not kneel 
down.&nbsp; They also declared guilty of treason, Lady Jane Grey 
for aspiring to the Crown; her husband, for being her husband; 
and Cranmer, for not believing in the mass aforesaid.&nbsp; They 
then prayed the Queen graciously to choose a husband for herself,
as soon as might be.</p>
<p>Now, the question who should be the Queen&rsquo;s husband had 
given rise to a great deal of discussion, and to several 
contending parties.&nbsp; Some said Cardinal Pole was the 
man&mdash;but the Queen was of opinion that he was <i>not</i> the
man, he being too old and too much of a student.&nbsp; Others 
said that the gallant young <span class="smcap">Courtenay</span>,
whom the Queen had made Earl of Devonshire, was the man&mdash;and
the Queen thought so too, for a while; but she changed her 
mind.&nbsp; At last it appeared that <span 
class="smcap">Philip</span>, <span class="smcap">Prince of 
Spain</span>, was certainly the man&mdash;though certainly not 
the people&rsquo;s man; for they detested the idea of such a 
marriage from the beginning to the end, and murmured that the 
Spaniard would establish in England, by the aid of foreign 
soldiers, the worst abuses of the Popish religion, and even the 
terrible Inquisition itself.</p>
<p>These discontents gave rise to a conspiracy for marrying young
Courtenay to the Princess Elizabeth, and setting them up, with 
popular tumults all over the kingdom, against the Queen.&nbsp; 
This was discovered in time by Gardiner; but in Kent, the old 
bold county, the people rose in their old bold way.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Sir Thomas Wyat</span>, a man of great daring, was 
their leader.&nbsp; He raised his standard at Maidstone, marched 
on to Rochester, established himself in the old castle there, and
prepared to hold out against the Duke of Norfolk, who came 
against him with a party of the Queen&rsquo;s guards, and a body 
of five hundred London men.&nbsp; The London men, however, were 
all for Elizabeth, and not at all for Mary.&nbsp; They declared, 
under the castle walls, for Wyat; the Duke retreated; and Wyat 
came on to Deptford, at the head of fifteen thousand men.</p>
<p>But these, in their turn, fell away.&nbsp; When he came to 
Southwark, there were only two thousand left.&nbsp; Not dismayed 
by finding the London citizens in arms, and the guns at the Tower
ready to oppose his crossing the river there, Wyat led them off 
to Kingston-upon-Thames, intending to cross the bridge that he 
knew to be in that place, and so to work his way round to 
Ludgate, one of the old gates of the City.&nbsp; He found the 
bridge broken down, but mended it, came across, and bravely 
fought his way up Fleet Street to Ludgate Hill.&nbsp; Finding the
gate closed against him, he fought his way back again, sword in 
hand, to Temple Bar.&nbsp; Here, being overpowered, he 
surrendered himself, and three or four hundred of his men were 
taken, besides a hundred killed.&nbsp; Wyat, in a moment of 
weakness (and perhaps of torture) was afterwards made to accuse 
the Princess Elizabeth as his accomplice to some very small 
extent.&nbsp; But his manhood soon returned to him, and he 
refused to save his life by making any more false 
confessions.&nbsp; He was quartered and distributed in the usual 
brutal way, and from fifty to a hundred of his followers were 
hanged.&nbsp; The rest were led out, with halters round their 
necks, to be pardoned, and to make a parade of crying out, 
&lsquo;God save Queen Mary!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the danger of this rebellion, the Queen showed herself to 
be a woman of courage and spirit.&nbsp; She disdained to retreat 
to any place of safety, and went down to the Guildhall, sceptre 
in hand, and made a gallant speech to the Lord Mayor and 
citizens.&nbsp; But on the day after Wyat&rsquo;s defeat, she did
the most cruel act, even of her cruel reign, in signing the 
warrant for the execution of Lady Jane Grey.</p>
<p>They tried to persuade Lady Jane to accept the unreformed 
religion; but she steadily refused.&nbsp; On the morning when she
was to die, she saw from her window the bleeding and headless 
body of her husband brought back in a cart from the scaffold on 
Tower Hill where he had laid down his life.&nbsp; But, as she had
declined to see him before his execution, lest she should be 
overpowered and not make a good end, so, she even now showed a 
constancy and calmness that will never be forgotten.&nbsp; She 
came up to the scaffold with a firm step and a quiet face, and 
addressed the bystanders in a steady voice.&nbsp; They were not 
numerous; for she was too young, too innocent and fair, to be 
murdered before the people on Tower Hill, as her husband had just
been; so, the place of her execution was within the Tower 
itself.&nbsp; She said that she had done an unlawful act in 
taking what was Queen Mary&rsquo;s right; but that she had done 
so with no bad intent, and that she died a humble 
Christian.&nbsp; She begged the executioner to despatch her 
quickly, and she asked him, &lsquo;Will you take my head off 
before I lay me down?&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered, &lsquo;No, 
Madam,&rsquo; and then she was very quiet while they bandaged her
eyes.&nbsp; Being blinded, and unable to see the block on which 
she was to lay her young head, she was seen to feel about for it 
with her hands, and was heard to say, confused, &lsquo;O what 
shall I do!&nbsp; Where is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then they guided her 
to the right place, and the executioner struck off her 
head.&nbsp; You know too well, now, what dreadful deeds the 
executioner did in England, through many, many years, and how his
axe descended on the hateful block through the necks of some of 
the bravest, wisest, and best in the land.&nbsp; But it never 
struck so cruel and so vile a blow as this.</p>
<p>The father of Lady Jane soon followed, but was little 
pitied.&nbsp; Queen Mary&rsquo;s next object was to lay hold of 
Elizabeth, and this was pursued with great eagerness.&nbsp; Five 
hundred men were sent to her retired house at Ashridge, by 
Berkhampstead, with orders to bring her up, alive or dead.&nbsp; 
They got there at ten at night, when she was sick in bed.&nbsp; 
But, their leaders followed her lady into her bedchamber, whence 
she was brought out betimes next morning, and put into a litter 
to be conveyed to London.&nbsp; She was so weak and ill, that she
was five days on the road; still, she was so resolved to be seen 
by the people that she had the curtains of the litter opened; and
so, very pale and sickly, passed through the streets.&nbsp; She 
wrote to her sister, saying she was innocent of any crime, and 
asking why she was made a prisoner; but she got no answer, and 
was ordered to the Tower.&nbsp; They took her in by the 
Traitor&rsquo;s Gate, to which she objected, but in vain.&nbsp; 
One of the lords who conveyed her offered to cover her with his 
cloak, as it was raining, but she put it away from her, proudly 
and scornfully, and passed into the Tower, and sat down in a 
court-yard on a stone.&nbsp; They besought her to come in out of 
the wet; but she answered that it was better sitting there, than 
in a worse place.&nbsp; At length she went to her apartment, 
where she was kept a prisoner, though not so close a prisoner as 
at Woodstock, whither she was afterwards removed, and where she 
is said to have one day envied a milkmaid whom she heard singing 
in the sunshine as she went through the green fields.&nbsp; 
Gardiner, than whom there were not many worse men among the 
fierce and sullen priests, cared little to keep secret his stern 
desire for her death: being used to say that it was of little 
service to shake off the leaves, and lop the branches of the tree
of heresy, if its root, the hope of heretics, were left.&nbsp; He
failed, however, in his benevolent design.&nbsp; Elizabeth was, 
at length, released; and Hatfield House was assigned to her as a 
residence, under the care of one <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas 
Pope</span>.</p>
<p>It would seem that Philip, the Prince of Spain, was a main 
cause of this change in Elizabeth&rsquo;s fortunes.&nbsp; He was 
not an amiable man, being, on the contrary, proud, overbearing, 
and gloomy; but he and the Spanish lords who came over with him, 
assuredly did discountenance the idea of doing any violence to 
the Princess.&nbsp; It may have been mere prudence, but we will 
hope it was manhood and honour.&nbsp; The Queen had been 
expecting her husband with great impatience, and at length he 
came, to her great joy, though he never cared much for her.&nbsp;
They were married by Gardiner, at Winchester, and there was more 
holiday-making among the people; but they had their old distrust 
of this Spanish marriage, in which even the Parliament 
shared.&nbsp; Though the members of that Parliament were far from
honest, and were strongly suspected to have been bought with 
Spanish money, they would pass no bill to enable the Queen to set
aside the Princess Elizabeth and appoint her own successor.</p>
<p>Although Gardiner failed in this object, as well as in the 
darker one of bringing the Princess to the scaffold, he went on 
at a great pace in the revival of the unreformed religion.&nbsp; 
A new Parliament was packed, in which there were no 
Protestants.&nbsp; Preparations were made to receive Cardinal 
Pole in England as the Pope&rsquo;s messenger, bringing his holy 
declaration that all the nobility who had acquired Church 
property, should keep it&mdash;which was done to enlist their 
selfish interest on the Pope&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Then a great 
scene was enacted, which was the triumph of the Queen&rsquo;s 
plans.&nbsp; Cardinal Pole arrived in great splendour and 
dignity, and was received with great pomp.&nbsp; The Parliament 
joined in a petition expressive of their sorrow at the change in 
the national religion, and praying him to receive the country 
again into the Popish Church.&nbsp; With the Queen sitting on her
throne, and the King on one side of her, and the Cardinal on the 
other, and the Parliament present, Gardiner read the petition 
aloud.&nbsp; The Cardinal then made a great speech, and was so 
obliging as to say that all was forgotten and forgiven, and that 
the kingdom was solemnly made Roman Catholic again.</p>
<p>Everything was now ready for the lighting of the terrible 
bonfires.&nbsp; The Queen having declared to the Council, in 
writing, that she would wish none of her subjects to be burnt 
without some of the Council being present, and that she would 
particularly wish there to be good sermons at all burnings, the 
Council knew pretty well what was to be done next.&nbsp; So, 
after the Cardinal had blessed all the bishops as a preface to 
the burnings, the Chancellor Gardiner opened a High Court at 
Saint Mary Overy, on the Southwark side of London Bridge, for the
trial of heretics.&nbsp; Here, two of the late Protestant 
clergymen, <span class="smcap">Hooper</span>, Bishop of 
Gloucester, and <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>, a Prebendary 
of St. Paul&rsquo;s, were brought to be tried.&nbsp; Hooper was 
tried first for being married, though a priest, and for not 
believing in the mass.&nbsp; He admitted both of these 
accusations, and said that the mass was a wicked 
imposition.&nbsp; Then they tried Rogers, who said the 
same.&nbsp; Next morning the two were brought up to be sentenced;
and then Rogers said that his poor wife, being a German woman and
a stranger in the land, he hoped might be allowed to come to 
speak to him before he died.&nbsp; To this the inhuman Gardiner 
replied, that she was not his wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yea, but she is,
my lord,&rsquo; said Rogers, &lsquo;and she hath been my wife 
these eighteen years.&rsquo;&nbsp; His request was still refused,
and they were both sent to Newgate; all those who stood in the 
streets to sell things, being ordered to put out their lights 
that the people might not see them.&nbsp; But, the people stood 
at their doors with candles in their hands, and prayed for them 
as they went by.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, Rogers was taken out of 
jail to be burnt in Smithfield; and, in the crowd as he went 
along, he saw his poor wife and his ten children, of whom the 
youngest was a little baby.&nbsp; And so he was burnt to 
death.</p>
<p>The next day, Hooper, who was to be burnt at Gloucester, was 
brought out to take his last journey, and was made to wear a hood
over his face that he might not be known by the people.&nbsp; 
But, they did know him for all that, down in his own part of the 
country; and, when he came near Gloucester, they lined the road, 
making prayers and lamentations.&nbsp; His guards took him to a 
lodging, where he slept soundly all night.&nbsp; At nine 
o&rsquo;clock next morning, he was brought forth leaning on a 
staff; for he had taken cold in prison, and was infirm.&nbsp; The
iron stake, and the iron chain which was to bind him to it, were 
fixed up near a great elm-tree in a pleasant open place before 
the cathedral, where, on peaceful Sundays, he had been accustomed
to preach and to pray, when he was bishop of Gloucester.&nbsp; 
This tree, which had no leaves then, it being February, was 
filled with people; and the priests of Gloucester College were 
looking complacently on from a window, and there was a great 
concourse of spectators in every spot from which a glimpse of the
dreadful sight could be beheld.&nbsp; When the old man kneeled 
down on the small platform at the foot of the stake, and prayed 
aloud, the nearest people were observed to be so attentive to his
prayers that they were ordered to stand farther back; for it did 
not suit the Romish Church to have those Protestant words 
heard.&nbsp; His prayers concluded, he went up to the stake and 
was stripped to his shirt, and chained ready for the fire.&nbsp; 
One of his guards had such compassion on him that, to shorten his
agonies, he tied some packets of gunpowder about him.&nbsp; Then 
they heaped up wood and straw and reeds, and set them all 
alight.&nbsp; But, unhappily, the wood was green and damp, and 
there was a wind blowing that blew what flame there was, 
away.&nbsp; Thus, through three-quarters of an hour, the good old
man was scorched and roasted and smoked, as the fire rose and 
sank; and all that time they saw him, as he burned, moving his 
lips in prayer, and beating his breast with one hand, even after 
the other was burnt away and had fallen off.</p>
<p>Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, were taken to Oxford to dispute 
with a commission of priests and doctors about the mass.&nbsp; 
They were shamefully treated; and it is recorded that the Oxford 
scholars hissed and howled and groaned, and misconducted 
themselves in an anything but a scholarly way.&nbsp; The 
prisoners were taken back to jail, and afterwards tried in St. 
Mary&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; They were all found guilty.&nbsp; On 
the sixteenth of the month of October, Ridley and Latimer were 
brought out, to make another of the dreadful bonfires.</p>
<p>The scene of the suffering of these two good Protestant men 
was in the City ditch, near Baliol College.&nbsp; On coming to 
the dreadful spot, they kissed the stakes, and then embraced each
other.&nbsp; And then a learned doctor got up into a pulpit which
was placed there, and preached a sermon from the text, 
&lsquo;Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, 
it profiteth me nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; When you think of the 
charity of burning men alive, you may imagine that this learned 
doctor had a rather brazen face.&nbsp; Ridley would have answered
his sermon when it came to an end, but was not allowed.&nbsp; 
When Latimer was stripped, it appeared that he had dressed 
himself under his other clothes, in a new shroud; and, as he 
stood in it before all the people, it was noted of him, and long 
remembered, that, whereas he had been stooping and feeble but a 
few minutes before, he now stood upright and handsome, in the 
knowledge that he was dying for a just and a great cause.&nbsp; 
Ridley&rsquo;s brother-in-law was there with bags of gunpowder; 
and when they were both chained up, he tied them round their 
bodies.&nbsp; Then, a light was thrown upon the pile to fire 
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be of good comfort, Master Ridley,&rsquo; said 
Latimer, at that awful moment, &lsquo;and play the man!&nbsp; We 
shall this day light such a candle, by God&rsquo;s grace, in 
England, as I trust shall never be put out.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then
he was seen to make motions with his hands as if he were washing 
them in the flames, and to stroke his aged face with them, and 
was heard to cry, &lsquo;Father of Heaven, receive my 
soul!&rsquo;&nbsp; He died quickly, but the fire, after having 
burned the legs of Ridley, sunk.&nbsp; There he lingered, chained
to the iron post, and crying, &lsquo;O!&nbsp; I cannot 
burn!&nbsp; O! for Christ&rsquo;s sake let the fire come unto 
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; And still, when his brother-in-law had heaped on
more wood, he was heard through the blinding smoke, still 
dismally crying, &lsquo;O!&nbsp; I cannot burn, I cannot 
burn!&rsquo;&nbsp; At last, the gunpowder caught fire, and ended 
his miseries.</p>
<p>Five days after this fearful scene, Gardiner went to his 
tremendous account before God, for the cruelties he had so much 
assisted in committing.</p>
<p>Cranmer remained still alive and in prison.&nbsp; He was 
brought out again in February, for more examining and trying, by 
Bonner, Bishop of London: another man of blood, who had succeeded
to Gardiner&rsquo;s work, even in his lifetime, when Gardiner was
tired of it.&nbsp; Cranmer was now degraded as a priest, and left
for death; but, if the Queen hated any one on earth, she hated 
him, and it was resolved that he should be ruined and disgraced 
to the utmost.&nbsp; There is no doubt that the Queen and her 
husband personally urged on these deeds, because they wrote to 
the Council, urging them to be active in the kindling of the 
fearful fires.&nbsp; As Cranmer was known not to be a firm man, a
plan was laid for surrounding him with artful people, and 
inducing him to recant to the unreformed religion.&nbsp; Deans 
and friars visited him, played at bowls with him, showed him 
various attentions, talked persuasively with him, gave him money 
for his prison comforts, and induced him to sign, I fear, as many
as six recantations.&nbsp; But when, after all, he was taken out 
to be burnt, he was nobly true to his better self, and made a 
glorious end.</p>
<p>After prayers and a sermon, Dr. Cole, the preacher of the day 
(who had been one of the artful priests about Cranmer in prison),
required him to make a public confession of his faith before the 
people.&nbsp; This, Cole did, expecting that he would declare 
himself a Roman Catholic.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will make a profession 
of my faith,&rsquo; said Cranmer, &lsquo;and with a good will 
too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, he arose before them all, and took from the sleeve of 
his robe a written prayer and read it aloud.&nbsp; That done, he 
kneeled and said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, all the people joining;
and then he arose again and told them that he believed in the 
Bible, and that in what he had lately written, he had written 
what was not the truth, and that, because his right hand had 
signed those papers, he would burn his right hand first when he 
came to the fire.&nbsp; As for the Pope, he did refuse him and 
denounce him as the enemy of Heaven.&nbsp; Hereupon the pious Dr.
Cole cried out to the guards to stop that heretic&rsquo;s mouth 
and take him away.</p>
<p>So they took him away, and chained him to the stake, where he 
hastily took off his own clothes to make ready for the 
flames.&nbsp; And he stood before the people with a bald head and
a white and flowing beard.&nbsp; He was so firm now when the 
worst was come, that he again declared against his recantation, 
and was so impressive and so undismayed, that a certain lord, who
was one of the directors of the execution, called out to the men 
to make haste!&nbsp; When the fire was lighted, Cranmer, true to 
his latest word, stretched out his right hand, and crying out, 
&lsquo;This hand hath offended!&rsquo; held it among the flames, 
until it blazed and burned away.&nbsp; His heart was found entire
among his ashes, and he left at last a memorable name in English 
history.&nbsp; Cardinal Pole celebrated the day by saying his 
first mass, and next day he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 
Cranmer&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s husband, who was now mostly abroad in his 
own dominions, and generally made a coarse jest of her to his 
more familiar courtiers, was at war with France, and came over to
seek the assistance of England.&nbsp; England was very unwilling 
to engage in a French war for his sake; but it happened that the 
King of France, at this very time, aided a descent upon the 
English coast.&nbsp; Hence, war was declared, greatly to 
Philip&rsquo;s satisfaction; and the Queen raised a sum of money 
with which to carry it on, by every unjustifiable means in her 
power.&nbsp; It met with no profitable return, for the French 
Duke of Guise surprised Calais, and the English sustained a 
complete defeat.&nbsp; The losses they met with in France greatly
mortified the national pride, and the Queen never recovered the 
blow.</p>
<p>There was a bad fever raging in England at this time, and I am
glad to write that the Queen took it, and the hour of her death 
came.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I am dead and my body is opened,&rsquo; 
she said to those around those around her, &lsquo;ye shall find 
<span class="smcap">Calais</span> written on my 
heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should have thought, if anything were 
written on it, they would have found the words&mdash;<span 
class="smcap">Jane Grey</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Hooper</span>, <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>, 
<span class="smcap">Ridley</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Latimer</span>, <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>,
<span class="smcap">and three hundred people burnt alive within 
four years of my wicked reign</span>, <span 
class="smcap">including sixty women and forty little 
children</span>.&nbsp; But it is enough that their deaths were 
written in Heaven.</p>
<p>The Queen died on the seventeenth of November, fifteen hundred
and fifty-eight, after reigning not quite five years and a half, 
and in the forty-fourth year of her age.&nbsp; Cardinal Pole died
of the same fever next day.</p>
<p>As <span class="smcap">Bloody Queen Mary</span>, this woman 
has become famous, and as <span class="smcap">Bloody Queen 
Mary</span>, she will ever be justly remembered with horror and 
detestation in Great Britain.&nbsp; Her memory has been held in 
such abhorrence that some writers have arisen in later years to 
take her part, and to show that she was, upon the whole, quite an
amiable and cheerful sovereign!&nbsp; &lsquo;By their fruits ye 
shall know them,&rsquo; said <span class="smcap">Our 
Saviour</span>.&nbsp; The stake and the fire were the fruits of 
this reign, and you will judge this Queen by nothing else.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH</h2>
<p>There was great rejoicing all over the land when the Lords of 
the Council went down to Hatfield, to hail the Princess Elizabeth
as the new Queen of England.&nbsp; Weary of the barbarities of 
Mary&rsquo;s reign, the people looked with hope and gladness to 
the new Sovereign.&nbsp; The nation seemed to wake from a 
horrible dream; and Heaven, so long hidden by the smoke of the 
fires that roasted men and women to death, appeared to brighten 
once more.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth was five-and-twenty years of age when she rode
through the streets of London, from the Tower to Westminster 
Abbey, to be crowned.&nbsp; Her countenance was strongly marked, 
but on the whole, commanding and dignified; her hair was red, and
her nose something too long and sharp for a woman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; 
She was not the beautiful creature her courtiers made out; but 
she was well enough, and no doubt looked all the better for 
coming after the dark and gloomy Mary.&nbsp; She was well 
educated, but a roundabout writer, and rather a hard swearer and 
coarse talker.&nbsp; She was clever, but cunning and deceitful, 
and inherited much of her father&rsquo;s violent temper.&nbsp; I 
mention this now, because she has been so over-praised by one 
party, and so over-abused by another, that it is hardly possible 
to understand the greater part of her reign without first 
understanding what kind of woman she really was.</p>
<p>She began her reign with the great advantage of having a very 
wise and careful Minister, <span class="smcap">Sir William 
Cecil</span>, whom she afterwards made <span class="smcap">Lord 
Burleigh</span>.&nbsp; Altogether, the people had greater reason 
for rejoicing than they usually had, when there were processions 
in the streets; and they were happy with some reason.&nbsp; All 
kinds of shows and images were set up; <span 
class="smcap">Gog</span> and <span class="smcap">Magog</span> 
were hoisted to the top of Temple Bar, and (which was more to the
purpose) the Corporation dutifully presented the young Queen with
the sum of a thousand marks in gold&mdash;so heavy a present, 
that she was obliged to take it into her carriage with both 
hands.&nbsp; The coronation was a great success; and, on the next
day, one of the courtiers presented a petition to the new Queen, 
praying that as it was the custom to release some prisoners on 
such occasions, she would have the goodness to release the four 
Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and also the Apostle 
Saint Paul, who had been for some time shut up in a strange 
language so that the people could not get at them.</p>
<p>To this, the Queen replied that it would be better first to 
inquire of themselves whether they desired to be released or not;
and, as a means of finding out, a great public discussion&mdash;a
sort of religious tournament&mdash;was appointed to take place 
between certain champions of the two religions, in Westminster 
Abbey.&nbsp; You may suppose that it was soon made pretty clear 
to common sense, that for people to benefit by what they repeat 
or read, it is rather necessary they should understand something 
about it.&nbsp; Accordingly, a Church Service in plain English 
was settled, and other laws and regulations were made, completely
establishing the great work of the Reformation.&nbsp; The Romish 
bishops and champions were not harshly dealt with, all things 
considered; and the Queen&rsquo;s Ministers were both prudent and
merciful.</p>
<p>The one great trouble of this reign, and the unfortunate cause
of the greater part of such turmoil and bloodshed as occurred in 
it, was <span class="smcap">Mary Stuart</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Queen of Scots</span>.&nbsp; We will try to 
understand, in as few words as possible, who Mary was, what she 
was, and how she came to be a thorn in the royal pillow of 
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of the Queen Regent of Scotland, <span 
class="smcap">Mary of Guise</span>.&nbsp; She had been married, 
when a mere child, to the Dauphin, the son and heir of the King 
of France.&nbsp; The Pope, who pretended that no one could 
rightfully wear the crown of England without his gracious 
permission, was strongly opposed to Elizabeth, who had not asked 
for the said gracious permission.&nbsp; And as Mary Queen of 
Scots would have inherited the English crown in right of her 
birth, supposing the English Parliament not to have altered the 
succession, the Pope himself, and most of the discontented who 
were followers of his, maintained that Mary was the rightful 
Queen of England, and Elizabeth the wrongful Queen.&nbsp; Mary 
being so closely connected with France, and France being jealous 
of England, there was far greater danger in this than there would
have been if she had had no alliance with that great power.&nbsp;
And when her young husband, on the death of his father, became 
<span class="smcap">Francis the Second</span>, King of France, 
the matter grew very serious.&nbsp; For, the young couple styled 
themselves King and Queen of England, and the Pope was disposed 
to help them by doing all the mischief he could.</p>
<p>Now, the reformed religion, under the guidance of a stern and 
powerful preacher, named <span class="smcap">John Knox</span>, 
and other such men, had been making fierce progress in 
Scotland.&nbsp; It was still a half savage country, where there 
was a great deal of murdering and rioting continually going on; 
and the Reformers, instead of reforming those evils as they 
should have done, went to work in the ferocious old Scottish 
spirit, laying churches and chapels waste, pulling down pictures 
and altars, and knocking about the Grey Friars, and the Black 
Friars, and the White Friars, and the friars of all sorts of 
colours, in all directions.&nbsp; This obdurate and harsh spirit 
of the Scottish Reformers (the Scotch have always been rather a 
sullen and frowning people in religious matters) put up the blood
of the Romish French court, and caused France to send troops over
to Scotland, with the hope of setting the friars of all sorts of 
colours on their legs again; of conquering that country first, 
and England afterwards; and so crushing the Reformation all to 
pieces.&nbsp; The Scottish Reformers, who had formed a great 
league which they called The Congregation of the Lord, secretly 
represented to Elizabeth that, if the reformed religion got the 
worst of it with them, it would be likely to get the worst of it 
in England too; and thus, Elizabeth, though she had a high notion
of the rights of Kings and Queens to do anything they liked, sent
an army to Scotland to support the Reformers, who were in arms 
against their sovereign.&nbsp; All these proceedings led to a 
treaty of peace at Edinburgh, under which the French consented to
depart from the kingdom.&nbsp; By a separate treaty, Mary and her
young husband engaged to renounce their assumed title of King and
Queen of England.&nbsp; But this treaty they never fulfilled.</p>
<p>It happened, soon after matters had got to this state, that 
the young French King died, leaving Mary a young widow.&nbsp; She
was then invited by her Scottish subjects to return home and 
reign over them; and as she was not now happy where she was, she,
after a little time, complied.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had been Queen three years, when Mary Queen of Scots
embarked at Calais for her own rough, quarrelling country.&nbsp; 
As she came out of the harbour, a vessel was lost before her 
eyes, and she said, &lsquo;O! good God! what an omen this is for 
such a voyage!&rsquo;&nbsp; She was very fond of France, and sat 
on the deck, looking back at it and weeping, until it was quite 
dark.&nbsp; When she went to bed, she directed to be called at 
daybreak, if the French coast were still visible, that she might 
behold it for the last time.&nbsp; As it proved to be a clear 
morning, this was done, and she again wept for the country she 
was leaving, and said many times, &lsquo;Farewell, France!&nbsp; 
Farewell, France!&nbsp; I shall never see thee 
again!&rsquo;&nbsp; All this was long remembered afterwards, as 
sorrowful and interesting in a fair young princess of 
nineteen.&nbsp; Indeed, I am afraid it gradually came, together 
with her other distresses, to surround her with greater sympathy 
than she deserved.</p>
<p>When she came to Scotland, and took up her abode at the palace
of Holyrood in Edinburgh, she found herself among uncouth 
strangers and wild uncomfortable customs very different from her 
experiences in the court of France.&nbsp; The very people who 
were disposed to love her, made her head ache when she was tired 
out by her voyage, with a serenade of discordant music&mdash;a 
fearful concert of bagpipes, I suppose&mdash;and brought her and 
her train home to her palace on miserable little Scotch horses 
that appeared to be half starved.&nbsp; Among the people who were
not disposed to love her, she found the powerful leaders of the 
Reformed Church, who were bitter upon her amusements, however 
innocent, and denounced music and dancing as works of the 
devil.&nbsp; John Knox himself often lectured her, violently and 
angrily, and did much to make her life unhappy.&nbsp; All these 
reasons confirmed her old attachment to the Romish religion, and 
caused her, there is no doubt, most imprudently and dangerously 
both for herself and for England too, to give a solemn pledge to 
the heads of the Romish Church that if she ever succeeded to the 
English crown, she would set up that religion again.&nbsp; In 
reading her unhappy history, you must always remember this; and 
also that during her whole life she was constantly put forward 
against the Queen, in some form or other, by the Romish 
party.</p>
<p>That Elizabeth, on the other hand, was not inclined to like 
her, is pretty certain.&nbsp; Elizabeth was very vain and 
jealous, and had an extraordinary dislike to people being 
married.&nbsp; She treated Lady Catherine Grey, sister of the 
beheaded Lady Jane, with such shameful severity, for no other 
reason than her being secretly married, that she died and her 
husband was ruined; so, when a second marriage for Mary began to 
be talked about, probably Elizabeth disliked her more.&nbsp; Not 
that Elizabeth wanted suitors of her own, for they started up 
from Spain, Austria, Sweden, and England.&nbsp; Her English lover
at this time, and one whom she much favoured too, was <span 
class="smcap">Lord Robert Dudley</span>, Earl of 
Leicester&mdash;himself secretly married to <span 
class="smcap">Amy Robsart</span>, the daughter of an English 
gentleman, whom he was strongly suspected of causing to be 
murdered, down at his country seat, Cumnor Hall in Berkshire, 
that he might be free to marry the Queen.&nbsp; Upon this story, 
the great writer, <span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott</span>, 
has founded one of his best romances.&nbsp; But if Elizabeth knew
how to lead her handsome favourite on, for her own vanity and 
pleasure, she knew how to stop him for her own pride; and his 
love, and all the other proposals, came to nothing.&nbsp; The 
Queen always declared in good set speeches, that she would never 
be married at all, but would live and die a Maiden Queen.&nbsp; 
It was a very pleasant and meritorious declaration, I suppose; 
but it has been puffed and trumpeted so much, that I am rather 
tired of it myself.</p>
<p>Divers princes proposed to marry Mary, but the English court 
had reasons for being jealous of them all, and even proposed as a
matter of policy that she should marry that very Earl of 
Leicester who had aspired to be the husband of Elizabeth.&nbsp; 
At last, <span class="smcap">Lord Darnley</span>, son of the Earl
of Lennox, and himself descended from the Royal Family of 
Scotland, went over with Elizabeth&rsquo;s consent to try his 
fortune at Holyrood.&nbsp; He was a tall simpleton; and could 
dance and play the guitar; but I know of nothing else he could 
do, unless it were to get very drunk, and eat gluttonously, and 
make a contemptible spectacle of himself in many mean and vain 
ways.&nbsp; However, he gained Mary&rsquo;s heart, not disdaining
in the pursuit of his object to ally himself with one of her 
secretaries, <span class="smcap">David Rizzio</span>, who had 
great influence with her.&nbsp; He soon married the Queen.&nbsp; 
This marriage does not say much for her, but what followed will 
presently say less.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s brother, the <span class="smcap">Earl of 
Murray</span>, and head of the Protestant party in Scotland, had 
opposed this marriage, partly on religious grounds, and partly 
perhaps from personal dislike of the very contemptible 
bridegroom.&nbsp; When it had taken place, through Mary&rsquo;s 
gaining over to it the more powerful of the lords about her, she 
banished Murray for his pains; and, when he and some other nobles
rose in arms to support the reformed religion, she herself, 
within a month of her wedding day, rode against them in armour 
with loaded pistols in her saddle.&nbsp; Driven out of Scotland, 
they presented themselves before Elizabeth&mdash;who called them 
traitors in public, and assisted them in private, according to 
her crafty nature.</p>
<p>Mary had been married but a little while, when she began to 
hate her husband, who, in his turn, began to hate that David 
Rizzio, with whom he had leagued to gain her favour, and whom he 
now believed to be her lover.&nbsp; He hated Rizzio to that 
extent, that he made a compact with <span class="smcap">Lord 
Ruthven</span> and three other lords to get rid of him by 
murder.&nbsp; This wicked agreement they made in solemn secrecy 
upon the first of March, fifteen hundred and sixty-six, and on 
the night of Saturday the ninth, the conspirators were brought by
Darnley up a private staircase, dark and steep, into a range of 
rooms where they knew that Mary was sitting at supper with her 
sister, Lady Argyle, and this doomed man.&nbsp; When they went 
into the room, Darnley took the Queen round the waist, and Lord 
Ruthven, who had risen from a bed of sickness to do this murder, 
came in, gaunt and ghastly, leaning on two men.&nbsp; Rizzio ran 
behind the Queen for shelter and protection.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let him
come out of the room,&rsquo; said Ruthven.&nbsp; &lsquo;He shall 
not leave the room,&rsquo; replied the Queen; &lsquo;I read his 
danger in your face, and it is my will that he remain 
here.&rsquo;&nbsp; They then set upon him, struggled with him, 
overturned the table, dragged him out, and killed him with 
fifty-six stabs.&nbsp; When the Queen heard that he was dead, she
said, &lsquo;No more tears.&nbsp; I will think now of 
revenge!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Within a day or two, she gained her husband over, and 
prevailed on the tall idiot to abandon the conspirators and fly 
with her to Dunbar.&nbsp; There, he issued a proclamation, 
audaciously and falsely denying that he had any knowledge of the 
late bloody business; and there they were joined by the <span 
class="smcap">Earl Bothwell</span> and some other nobles.&nbsp; 
With their help, they raised eight thousand men; returned to 
Edinburgh, and drove the assassins into England.&nbsp; Mary soon 
afterwards gave birth to a son&mdash;still thinking of 
revenge.</p>
<p>That she should have had a greater scorn for her husband after
his late cowardice and treachery than she had had before, was 
natural enough.&nbsp; There is little doubt that she now began to
love Bothwell instead, and to plan with him means of getting rid 
of Darnley.&nbsp; Bothwell had such power over her that he 
induced her even to pardon the assassins of Rizzio.&nbsp; The 
arrangements for the Christening of the young Prince were 
entrusted to him, and he was one of the most important people at 
the ceremony, where the child was named <span 
class="smcap">James</span>: Elizabeth being his godmother, though
not present on the occasion.&nbsp; A week afterwards, Darnley, 
who had left Mary and gone to his father&rsquo;s house at 
Glasgow, being taken ill with the small-pox, she sent her own 
physician to attend him.&nbsp; But there is reason to apprehend 
that this was merely a show and a pretence, and that she knew 
what was doing, when Bothwell within another month proposed to 
one of the late conspirators against Rizzio, to murder Darnley, 
&lsquo;for that it was the Queen&rsquo;s mind that he should be 
taken away.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is certain that on that very day she 
wrote to her ambassador in France, complaining of him, and yet 
went immediately to Glasgow, feigning to be very anxious about 
him, and to love him very much.&nbsp; If she wanted to get him in
her power, she succeeded to her heart&rsquo;s content; for she 
induced him to go back with her to Edinburgh, and to occupy, 
instead of the palace, a lone house outside the city called the 
Kirk of Field.&nbsp; Here, he lived for about a week.&nbsp; One 
Sunday night, she remained with him until ten o&rsquo;clock, and 
then left him, to go to Holyrood to be present at an 
entertainment given in celebration of the marriage of one of her 
favourite servants.&nbsp; At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning the
city was shaken by a great explosion, and the Kirk of Field was 
blown to atoms.</p>
<p>Darnley&rsquo;s body was found next day lying under a tree at 
some distance.&nbsp; How it came there, undisfigured and 
unscorched by gunpowder, and how this crime came to be so 
clumsily and strangely committed, it is impossible to 
discover.&nbsp; The deceitful character of Mary, and the 
deceitful character of Elizabeth, have rendered almost every part
of their joint history uncertain and obscure.&nbsp; But, I fear 
that Mary was unquestionably a party to her husband&rsquo;s 
murder, and that this was the revenge she had threatened.&nbsp; 
The Scotch people universally believed it.&nbsp; Voices cried out
in the streets of Edinburgh in the dead of the night, for justice
on the murderess.&nbsp; Placards were posted by unknown hands in 
the public places denouncing Bothwell as the murderer, and the 
Queen as his accomplice; and, when he afterwards married her 
(though himself already married), previously making a show of 
taking her prisoner by force, the indignation of the people knew 
no bounds.&nbsp; The women particularly are described as having 
been quite frantic against the Queen, and to have hooted and 
cried after her in the streets with terrific vehemence.</p>
<p>Such guilty unions seldom prosper.&nbsp; This husband and wife
had lived together but a month, when they were separated for ever
by the successes of a band of Scotch nobles who associated 
against them for the protection of the young Prince: whom 
Bothwell had vainly endeavoured to lay hold of, and whom he would
certainly have murdered, if the <span class="smcap">Earl of 
Mar</span>, in whose hands the boy was, had not been firmly and 
honourably faithful to his trust.&nbsp; Before this angry power, 
Bothwell fled abroad, where he died, a prisoner and mad, nine 
miserable years afterwards.&nbsp; Mary being found by the 
associated lords to deceive them at every turn, was sent a 
prisoner to Lochleven Castle; which, as it stood in the midst of 
a lake, could only be approached by boat.&nbsp; Here, one <span 
class="smcap">Lord Lindsay</span>, who was so much of a brute 
that the nobles would have done better if they had chosen a mere 
gentleman for their messenger, made her sign her abdication, and 
appoint Murray, Regent of Scotland.&nbsp; Here, too, Murray saw 
her in a sorrowing and humbled state.</p>
<p>She had better have remained in the castle of Lochleven, dull 
prison as it was, with the rippling of the lake against it, and 
the moving shadows of the water on the room walls; but she could 
not rest there, and more than once tried to escape.&nbsp; The 
first time she had nearly succeeded, dressed in the clothes of 
her own washer-woman, but, putting up her hand to prevent one of 
the boatmen from lifting her veil, the men suspected her, seeing 
how white it was, and rowed her back again.&nbsp; A short time 
afterwards, her fascinating manners enlisted in her cause a boy 
in the Castle, called the little <span 
class="smcap">Douglas</span>, who, while the family were at 
supper, stole the keys of the great gate, went softly out with 
the Queen, locked the gate on the outside, and rowed her away 
across the lake, sinking the keys as they went along.&nbsp; On 
the opposite shore she was met by another Douglas, and some few 
lords; and, so accompanied, rode away on horseback to Hamilton, 
where they raised three thousand men.&nbsp; Here, she issued a 
proclamation declaring that the abdication she had signed in her 
prison was illegal, and requiring the Regent to yield to his 
lawful Queen.&nbsp; Being a steady soldier, and in no way 
discomposed although he was without an army, Murray pretended to 
treat with her, until he had collected a force about half equal 
to her own, and then he gave her battle.&nbsp; In one quarter of 
an hour he cut down all her hopes.&nbsp; She had another weary 
ride on horse-back of sixty long Scotch miles, and took shelter 
at Dundrennan Abbey, whence she fled for safety to 
Elizabeth&rsquo;s dominions.</p>
<p>Mary Queen of Scots came to England&mdash;to her own ruin, the
trouble of the kingdom, and the misery and death of many&mdash;in
the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-eight.&nbsp; How she
left it and the world, nineteen years afterwards, we have now to 
see.</p>
<h3>SECOND PART</h3>
<p>When Mary Queen of Scots arrived in England, without money and
even without any other clothes than those she wore, she wrote to 
Elizabeth, representing herself as an innocent and injured piece 
of Royalty, and entreating her assistance to oblige her Scottish 
subjects to take her back again and obey her.&nbsp; But, as her 
character was already known in England to be a very different one
from what she made it out to be, she was told in answer that she 
must first clear herself.&nbsp; Made uneasy by this condition, 
Mary, rather than stay in England, would have gone to Spain, or 
to France, or would even have gone back to Scotland.&nbsp; But, 
as her doing either would have been likely to trouble England 
afresh, it was decided that she should be detained here.&nbsp; 
She first came to Carlisle, and, after that, was moved about from
castle to castle, as was considered necessary; but England she 
never left again.</p>
<p>After trying very hard to get rid of the necessity of clearing
herself, Mary, advised by <span class="smcap">Lord 
Herries</span>, her best friend in England, agreed to answer the 
charges against her, if the Scottish noblemen who made them would
attend to maintain them before such English noblemen as Elizabeth
might appoint for that purpose.&nbsp; Accordingly, such an 
assembly, under the name of a conference, met, first at York, and
afterwards at Hampton Court.&nbsp; In its presence Lord Lennox, 
Darnley&rsquo;s father, openly charged Mary with the murder of 
his son; and whatever Mary&rsquo;s friends may now say or write 
in her behalf, there is no doubt that, when her brother Murray 
produced against her a casket containing certain guilty letters 
and verses which he stated to have passed between her and 
Bothwell, she withdrew from the inquiry.&nbsp; Consequently, it 
is to be supposed that she was then considered guilty by those 
who had the best opportunities of judging of the truth, and that 
the feeling which afterwards arose in her behalf was a very 
generous but not a very reasonable one.</p>
<p>However, the <span class="smcap">Duke of Norfolk</span>, an 
honourable but rather weak nobleman, partly because Mary was 
captivating, partly because he was ambitious, partly because he 
was over-persuaded by artful plotters against Elizabeth, 
conceived a strong idea that he would like to marry the Queen of 
Scots&mdash;though he was a little frightened, too, by the 
letters in the casket.&nbsp; This idea being secretly encouraged 
by some of the noblemen of Elizabeth&rsquo;s court, and even by 
the favourite Earl of Leicester (because it was objected to by 
other favourites who were his rivals), Mary expressed her 
approval of it, and the King of France and the King of Spain are 
supposed to have done the same.&nbsp; It was not so quietly 
planned, though, but that it came to Elizabeth&rsquo;s ears, who 
warned the Duke &lsquo;to be careful what sort of pillow he was 
going to lay his head upon.&rsquo;&nbsp; He made a humble reply 
at the time; but turned sulky soon afterwards, and, being 
considered dangerous, was sent to the Tower.</p>
<p>Thus, from the moment of Mary&rsquo;s coming to England she 
began to be the centre of plots and miseries.</p>
<p>A rise of the Catholics in the north was the next of these, 
and it was only checked by many executions and much 
bloodshed.&nbsp; It was followed by a great conspiracy of the 
Pope and some of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe to depose 
Elizabeth, place Mary on the throne, and restore the unreformed 
religion.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to doubt that Mary knew 
and approved of this; and the Pope himself was so hot in the 
matter that he issued a bull, in which he openly called Elizabeth
the &lsquo;pretended Queen&rsquo; of England, excommunicated her,
and excommunicated all her subjects who should continue to obey 
her.&nbsp; A copy of this miserable paper got into London, and 
was found one morning publicly posted on the Bishop of 
London&rsquo;s gate.&nbsp; A great hue and cry being raised, 
another copy was found in the chamber of a student of 
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, who confessed, being put upon the rack, that
he had received it from one <span class="smcap">John 
Felton</span>, a rich gentleman who lived across the Thames, near
Southwark.&nbsp; This John Felton, being put upon the rack too, 
confessed that he had posted the placard on the Bishop&rsquo;s 
gate.&nbsp; For this offence he was, within four days, taken to 
St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, and there hanged and 
quartered.&nbsp; As to the Pope&rsquo;s bull, the people by the 
reformation having thrown off the Pope, did not care much, you 
may suppose, for the Pope&rsquo;s throwing off them.&nbsp; It was
a mere dirty piece of paper, and not half so powerful as a street
ballad.</p>
<p>On the very day when Felton was brought to his trial, the poor
Duke of Norfolk was released.&nbsp; It would have been well for 
him if he had kept away from the Tower evermore, and from the 
snares that had taken him there.&nbsp; But, even while he was in 
that dismal place he corresponded with Mary, and as soon as he 
was out of it, he began to plot again.&nbsp; Being discovered in 
correspondence with the Pope, with a view to a rising in England 
which should force Elizabeth to consent to his marriage with Mary
and to repeal the laws against the Catholics, he was re-committed
to the Tower and brought to trial.&nbsp; He was found guilty by 
the unanimous verdict of the Lords who tried him, and was 
sentenced to the block.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to make out, at this distance of time, 
and between opposite accounts, whether Elizabeth really was a 
humane woman, or desired to appear so, or was fearful of shedding
the blood of people of great name who were popular in the 
country.&nbsp; Twice she commanded and countermanded the 
execution of this Duke, and it did not take place until five 
months after his trial.&nbsp; The scaffold was erected on Tower 
Hill, and there he died like a brave man.&nbsp; He refused to 
have his eyes bandaged, saying that he was not at all afraid of 
death; and he admitted the justice of his sentence, and was much 
regretted by the people.</p>
<p>Although Mary had shrunk at the most important time from 
disproving her guilt, she was very careful never to do anything 
that would admit it.&nbsp; All such proposals as were made to her
by Elizabeth for her release, required that admission in some 
form or other, and therefore came to nothing.&nbsp; Moreover, 
both women being artful and treacherous, and neither ever 
trusting the other, it was not likely that they could ever make 
an agreement.&nbsp; So, the Parliament, aggravated by what the 
Pope had done, made new and strong laws against the spreading of 
the Catholic religion in England, and declared it treason in any 
one to say that the Queen and her successors were not the lawful 
sovereigns of England.&nbsp; It would have done more than this, 
but for Elizabeth&rsquo;s moderation.</p>
<p>Since the Reformation, there had come to be three great sects 
of religious people&mdash;or people who called themselves 
so&mdash;in England; that is to say, those who belonged to the 
Reformed Church, those who belonged to the Unreformed Church, and
those who were called the Puritans, because they said that they 
wanted to have everything very pure and plain in all the Church 
service.&nbsp; These last were for the most part an uncomfortable
people, who thought it highly meritorious to dress in a hideous 
manner, talk through their noses, and oppose all harmless 
enjoyments.&nbsp; But they were powerful too, and very much in 
earnest, and they were one and all the determined enemies of the 
Queen of Scots.&nbsp; The Protestant feeling in England was 
further strengthened by the tremendous cruelties to which 
Protestants were exposed in France and in the Netherlands.&nbsp; 
Scores of thousands of them were put to death in those countries 
with every cruelty that can be imagined, and at last, in the 
autumn of the year one thousand five hundred and seventy-two, one
of the greatest barbarities ever committed in the world took 
place at Paris.</p>
<p>It is called in history, <span class="smcap">The Massacre of 
Saint Bartholomew</span>, because it took place on Saint 
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Eve.&nbsp; The day fell on Saturday the 
twenty-third of August.&nbsp; On that day all the great leaders 
of the Protestants (who were there called <span 
class="smcap">Huguenots</span>) were assembled together, for the 
purpose, as was represented to them, of doing honour to the 
marriage of their chief, the young King of Navarre, with the 
sister of <span class="smcap">Charles the Ninth</span>: a 
miserable young King who then occupied the French throne.&nbsp; 
This dull creature was made to believe by his mother and other 
fierce Catholics about him that the Huguenots meant to take his 
life; and he was persuaded to give secret orders that, on the 
tolling of a great bell, they should be fallen upon by an 
overpowering force of armed men, and slaughtered wherever they 
could be found.&nbsp; When the appointed hour was close at hand, 
the stupid wretch, trembling from head to foot, was taken into a 
balcony by his mother to see the atrocious work begun.&nbsp; The 
moment the bell tolled, the murderers broke forth.&nbsp; During 
all that night and the two next days, they broke into the houses,
fired the houses, shot and stabbed the Protestants, men, women, 
and children, and flung their bodies into the streets.&nbsp; They
were shot at in the streets as they passed along, and their blood
ran down the gutters.&nbsp; Upwards of ten thousand Protestants 
were killed in Paris alone; in all France four or five times that
number.&nbsp; To return thanks to Heaven for these diabolical 
murders, the Pope and his train actually went in public 
procession at Rome, and as if this were not shame enough for 
them, they had a medal struck to commemorate the event.&nbsp; 
But, however comfortable the wholesale murders were to these high
authorities, they had not that soothing effect upon the 
doll-King.&nbsp; I am happy to state that he never knew a 
moment&rsquo;s peace afterwards; that he was continually crying 
out that he saw the Huguenots covered with blood and wounds 
falling dead before him; and that he died within a year, 
shrieking and yelling and raving to that degree, that if all the 
Popes who had ever lived had been rolled into one, they would not
have afforded His guilty Majesty the slightest consolation.</p>
<p>When the terrible news of the massacre arrived in England, it 
made a powerful impression indeed upon the people.&nbsp; If they 
began to run a little wild against the Catholics at about this 
time, this fearful reason for it, coming so soon after the days 
of bloody Queen Mary, must be remembered in their excuse.&nbsp; 
The Court was not quite so honest as the people&mdash;but perhaps
it sometimes is not.&nbsp; It received the French ambassador, 
with all the lords and ladies dressed in deep mourning, and 
keeping a profound silence.&nbsp; Nevertheless, a proposal of 
marriage which he had made to Elizabeth only two days before the 
eve of Saint Bartholomew, on behalf of the Duke of 
Alen&ccedil;on, the French King&rsquo;s brother, a boy of 
seventeen, still went on; while on the other hand, in her usual 
crafty way, the Queen secretly supplied the Huguenots with money 
and weapons.</p>
<p>I must say that for a Queen who made all those fine speeches, 
of which I have confessed myself to be rather tired, about living
and dying a Maiden Queen, Elizabeth was &lsquo;going&rsquo; to be
married pretty often.&nbsp; Besides always having some English 
favourite or other whom she by turns encouraged and swore at and 
knocked about&mdash;for the maiden Queen was very free with her 
fists&mdash;she held this French Duke off and on through several 
years.&nbsp; When he at last came over to England, the marriage 
articles were actually drawn up, and it was settled that the 
wedding should take place in six weeks.&nbsp; The Queen was then 
so bent upon it, that she prosecuted a poor Puritan named <span 
class="smcap">Stubbs</span>, and a poor bookseller named <span 
class="smcap">Page</span>, for writing and publishing a pamphlet 
against it.&nbsp; Their right hands were chopped off for this 
crime; and poor Stubbs&mdash;more loyal than I should have been 
myself under the circumstances&mdash;immediately pulled off his 
hat with his left hand, and cried, &lsquo;God save the 
Queen!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stubbs was cruelly treated; for the marriage 
never took place after all, though the Queen pledged herself to 
the Duke with a ring from her own finger.&nbsp; He went away, no 
better than he came, when the courtship had lasted some ten years
altogether; and he died a couple of years afterwards, mourned by 
Elizabeth, who appears to have been really fond of him.&nbsp; It 
is not much to her credit, for he was a bad enough member of a 
bad family.</p>
<p>To return to the Catholics.&nbsp; There arose two orders of 
priests, who were very busy in England, and who were much 
dreaded.&nbsp; These were the <span class="smcap">Jesuits</span> 
(who were everywhere in all sorts of disguises), and the <span 
class="smcap">Seminary Priests</span>.&nbsp; The people had a 
great horror of the first, because they were known to have taught
that murder was lawful if it were done with an object of which 
they approved; and they had a great horror of the second, because
they came to teach the old religion, and to be the successors of 
&lsquo;Queen Mary&rsquo;s priests,&rsquo; as those yet lingering 
in England were called, when they should die out.&nbsp; The 
severest laws were made against them, and were most unmercifully 
executed.&nbsp; Those who sheltered them in their houses often 
suffered heavily for what was an act of humanity; and the rack, 
that cruel torture which tore men&rsquo;s limbs asunder, was 
constantly kept going.&nbsp; What these unhappy men confessed, or
what was ever confessed by any one under that agony, must always 
be received with great doubt, as it is certain that people have 
frequently owned to the most absurd and impossible crimes to 
escape such dreadful suffering.&nbsp; But I cannot doubt it to 
have been proved by papers, that there were many plots, both 
among the Jesuits, and with France, and with Scotland, and with 
Spain, for the destruction of Queen Elizabeth, for the placing of
Mary on the throne, and for the revival of the old religion.</p>
<p>If the English people were too ready to believe in plots, 
there were, as I have said, good reasons for it.&nbsp; When the 
massacre of Saint Bartholomew was yet fresh in their 
recollection, a great Protestant Dutch hero, the <span 
class="smcap">Prince of Orange</span>, was shot by an assassin, 
who confessed that he had been kept and trained for the purpose 
in a college of Jesuits.&nbsp; The Dutch, in this surprise and 
distress, offered to make Elizabeth their sovereign, but she 
declined the honour, and sent them a small army instead, under 
the command of the Earl of Leicester, who, although a capital 
Court favourite, was not much of a general.&nbsp; He did so 
little in Holland, that his campaign there would probably have 
been forgotten, but for its occasioning the death of one of the 
best writers, the best knights, and the best gentlemen, of that 
or any age.&nbsp; This was <span class="smcap">Sir Philip 
Sidney</span>, who was wounded by a musket ball in the thigh as 
he mounted a fresh horse, after having had his own killed under 
him.&nbsp; He had to ride back wounded, a long distance, and was 
very faint with fatigue and loss of blood, when some water, for 
which he had eagerly asked, was handed to him.&nbsp; But he was 
so good and gentle even then, that seeing a poor badly wounded 
common soldier lying on the ground, looking at the water with 
longing eyes, he said, &lsquo;Thy necessity is greater than 
mine,&rsquo; and gave it up to him.&nbsp; This touching action of
a noble heart is perhaps as well known as any incident in 
history&mdash;is as famous far and wide as the blood-stained 
Tower of London, with its axe, and block, and murders out of 
number.&nbsp; So delightful is an act of true humanity, and so 
glad are mankind to remember it.</p>
<p>At home, intelligence of plots began to thicken every 
day.&nbsp; I suppose the people never did live under such 
continual terrors as those by which they were possessed now, of 
Catholic risings, and burnings, and poisonings, and I don&rsquo;t
know what.&nbsp; Still, we must always remember that they lived 
near and close to awful realities of that kind, and that with 
their experience it was not difficult to believe in any 
enormity.&nbsp; The government had the same fear, and did not 
take the best means of discovering the truth&mdash;for, besides 
torturing the suspected, it employed paid spies, who will always 
lie for their own profit.&nbsp; It even made some of the 
conspiracies it brought to light, by sending false letters to 
disaffected people, inviting them to join in pretended plots, 
which they too readily did.</p>
<p>But, one great real plot was at length discovered, and it 
ended the career of Mary, Queen of Scots.&nbsp; A seminary priest
named <span class="smcap">Ballard</span>, and a Spanish soldier 
named <span class="smcap">Savage</span>, set on and encouraged by
certain French priests, imparted a design to one <span 
class="smcap">Antony Babington</span>&mdash;a gentleman of 
fortune in Derbyshire, who had been for some time a secret agent 
of Mary&rsquo;s&mdash;for murdering the Queen.&nbsp; Babington 
then confided the scheme to some other Catholic gentlemen who 
were his friends, and they joined in it heartily.&nbsp; They were
vain, weak-headed young men, ridiculously confident, and 
preposterously proud of their plan; for they got a gimcrack 
painting made, of the six choice spirits who were to murder 
Elizabeth, with Babington in an attitude for the centre 
figure.&nbsp; Two of their number, however, one of whom was a 
priest, kept Elizabeth&rsquo;s wisest minister, <span 
class="smcap">Sir Francis Walsingham</span>, acquainted with the 
whole project from the first.&nbsp; The conspirators were 
completely deceived to the final point, when Babington gave 
Savage, because he was shabby, a ring from his finger, and some 
money from his purse, wherewith to buy himself new clothes in 
which to kill the Queen.&nbsp; Walsingham, having then full 
evidence against the whole band, and two letters of Mary&rsquo;s 
besides, resolved to seize them.&nbsp; Suspecting something 
wrong, they stole out of the city, one by one, and hid themselves
in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, and other places which really were 
hiding places then; but they were all taken, and all 
executed.&nbsp; When they were seized, a gentleman was sent from 
Court to inform Mary of the fact, and of her being involved in 
the discovery.&nbsp; Her friends have complained that she was 
kept in very hard and severe custody.&nbsp; It does not appear 
very likely, for she was going out a hunting that very 
morning.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth had been warned long ago, by one in France who
had good information of what was secretly doing, that in holding 
Mary alive, she held &lsquo;the wolf who would devour 
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bishop of London had, more lately, given 
the Queen&rsquo;s favourite minister the advice in writing, 
&lsquo;forthwith to cut off the Scottish Queen&rsquo;s 
head.&rsquo;&nbsp; The question now was, what to do with 
her?&nbsp; The Earl of Leicester wrote a little note home from 
Holland, recommending that she should be quietly poisoned; that 
noble favourite having accustomed his mind, it is possible, to 
remedies of that nature.&nbsp; His black advice, however, was 
disregarded, and she was brought to trial at Fotheringay Castle 
in Northamptonshire, before a tribunal of forty, composed of both
religions.&nbsp; There, and in the Star Chamber at Westminster, 
the trial lasted a fortnight.&nbsp; She defended herself with 
great ability, but could only deny the confessions that had been 
made by Babington and others; could only call her own letters, 
produced against her by her own secretaries, forgeries; and, in 
short, could only deny everything.&nbsp; She was found guilty, 
and declared to have incurred the penalty of death.&nbsp; The 
Parliament met, approved the sentence, and prayed the Queen to 
have it executed.&nbsp; The Queen replied that she requested them
to consider whether no means could be found of saving 
Mary&rsquo;s life without endangering her own.&nbsp; The 
Parliament rejoined, No; and the citizens illuminated their 
houses and lighted bonfires, in token of their joy that all these
plots and troubles were to be ended by the death of the Queen of 
Scots.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p240b.jpg">
<img alt="Mary Queen of Scots Reading the death warrant" 
src="images/p240s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>She, feeling sure that her time was now come, wrote a letter 
to the Queen of England, making three entreaties; first, that she
might be buried in France; secondly, that she might not be 
executed in secret, but before her servants and some others; 
thirdly, that after her death, her servants should not be 
molested, but should be suffered to go home with the legacies she
left them.&nbsp; It was an affecting letter, and Elizabeth shed 
tears over it, but sent no answer.&nbsp; Then came a special 
ambassador from France, and another from Scotland, to intercede 
for Mary&rsquo;s life; and then the nation began to clamour, more
and more, for her death.</p>
<p>What the real feelings or intentions of Elizabeth were, can 
never be known now; but I strongly suspect her of only wishing 
one thing more than Mary&rsquo;s death, and that was to keep free
of the blame of it.&nbsp; On the first of February, one thousand 
five hundred and eighty-seven, Lord Burleigh having drawn out the
warrant for the execution, the Queen sent to the secretary <span 
class="smcap">Davison</span> to bring it to her, that she might 
sign it: which she did.&nbsp; Next day, when Davison told her it 
was sealed, she angrily asked him why such haste was 
necessary?&nbsp; Next day but one, she joked about it, and swore 
a little.&nbsp; Again, next day but one, she seemed to complain 
that it was not yet done, but still she would not be plain with 
those about her.&nbsp; So, on the seventh, the Earls of Kent and 
Shrewsbury, with the Sheriff of Northamptonshire, came with the 
warrant to Fotheringay, to tell the Queen of Scots to prepare for
death.</p>
<p>When those messengers of ill omen were gone, Mary made a 
frugal supper, drank to her servants, read over her will, went to
bed, slept for some hours, and then arose and passed the 
remainder of the night saying prayers.&nbsp; In the morning she 
dressed herself in her best clothes; and, at eight o&rsquo;clock 
when the sheriff came for her to her chapel, took leave of her 
servants who were there assembled praying with her, and went 
down-stairs, carrying a Bible in one hand and a crucifix in the 
other.&nbsp; Two of her women and four of her men were allowed to
be present in the hall; where a low scaffold, only two feet from 
the ground, was erected and covered with black; and where the 
executioner from the Tower, and his assistant, stood, dressed in 
black velvet.&nbsp; The hall was full of people.&nbsp; While the 
sentence was being read she sat upon a stool; and, when it was 
finished, she again denied her guilt, as she had done 
before.&nbsp; The Earl of Kent and the Dean of Peterborough, in 
their Protestant zeal, made some very unnecessary speeches to 
her; to which she replied that she died in the Catholic religion,
and they need not trouble themselves about that matter.&nbsp; 
When her head and neck were uncovered by the executioners, she 
said that she had not been used to be undressed by such hands, or
before so much company.&nbsp; Finally, one of her women fastened 
a cloth over her face, and she laid her neck upon the block, and 
repeated more than once in Latin, &lsquo;Into thy hands, O Lord, 
I commend my spirit!&rsquo;&nbsp; Some say her head was struck 
off in two blows, some say in three.&nbsp; However that be, when 
it was held up, streaming with blood, the real hair beneath the 
false hair she had long worn was seen to be as grey as that of a 
woman of seventy, though she was at that time only in her 
forty-sixth year.&nbsp; All her beauty was gone.</p>
<p>But she was beautiful enough to her little dog, who cowered 
under her dress, frightened, when she went upon the scaffold, and
who lay down beside her headless body when all her earthly 
sorrows were over.</p>
<h3>THIRD PART</h3>
<p>On its being formally made known to Elizabeth that the 
sentence had been executed on the Queen of Scots, she showed the 
utmost grief and rage, drove her favourites from her with violent
indignation, and sent Davison to the Tower; from which place he 
was only released in the end by paying an immense fine which 
completely ruined him.&nbsp; Elizabeth not only over-acted her 
part in making these pretences, but most basely reduced to 
poverty one of her faithful servants for no other fault than 
obeying her commands.</p>
<p>James, King of Scotland, Mary&rsquo;s son, made a show 
likewise of being very angry on the occasion; but he was a 
pensioner of England to the amount of five thousand pounds a 
year, and he had known very little of his mother, and he possibly
regarded her as the murderer of his father, and he soon took it 
quietly.</p>
<p>Philip, King of Spain, however, threatened to do greater 
things than ever had been done yet, to set up the Catholic 
religion and punish Protestant England.&nbsp; Elizabeth, hearing 
that he and the Prince of Parma were making great preparations 
for this purpose, in order to be beforehand with them sent out 
<span class="smcap">Admiral Drake</span> (a famous navigator, who
had sailed about the world, and had already brought great plunder
from Spain) to the port of Cadiz, where he burnt a hundred 
vessels full of stores.&nbsp; This great loss obliged the 
Spaniards to put off the invasion for a year; but it was none the
less formidable for that, amounting to one hundred and thirty 
ships, nineteen thousand soldiers, eight thousand sailors, two 
thousand slaves, and between two and three thousand great 
guns.&nbsp; England was not idle in making ready to resist this 
great force.&nbsp; All the men between sixteen years old and 
sixty, were trained and drilled; the national fleet of ships (in 
number only thirty-four at first) was enlarged by public 
contributions and by private ships, fitted out by noblemen; the 
city of London, of its own accord, furnished double the number of
ships and men that it was required to provide; and, if ever the 
national spirit was up in England, it was up all through the 
country to resist the Spaniards.&nbsp; Some of the Queen&rsquo;s 
advisers were for seizing the principal English Catholics, and 
putting them to death; but the Queen&mdash;who, to her honour, 
used to say, that she would never believe any ill of her 
subjects, which a parent would not believe of her own 
children&mdash;rejected the advice, and only confined a few of 
those who were the most suspected, in the fens in 
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; The great body of Catholics deserved this 
confidence; for they behaved most loyally, nobly, and 
bravely.</p>
<p>So, with all England firing up like one strong, angry man, and
with both sides of the Thames fortified, and with the soldiers 
under arms, and with the sailors in their ships, the country 
waited for the coming of the proud Spanish fleet, which was 
called <span class="smcap">The Invincible Armada</span>.&nbsp; 
The Queen herself, riding in armour on a white horse, and the 
Earl of Essex and the Earl of Leicester holding her bridal rein, 
made a brave speech to the troops at Tilbury Fort opposite 
Gravesend, which was received with such enthusiasm as is seldom 
known.&nbsp; Then came the Spanish Armada into the English 
Channel, sailing along in the form of a half moon, of such great 
size that it was seven miles broad.&nbsp; But the English were 
quickly upon it, and woe then to all the Spanish ships that 
dropped a little out of the half moon, for the English took them 
instantly!&nbsp; And it soon appeared that the great Armada was 
anything but invincible, for on a summer night, bold Drake sent 
eight blazing fire-ships right into the midst of it.&nbsp; In 
terrible consternation the Spaniards tried to get out to sea, and
so became dispersed; the English pursued them at a great 
advantage; a storm came on, and drove the Spaniards among rocks 
and shoals; and the swift end of the Invincible fleet was, that 
it lost thirty great ships and ten thousand men, and, defeated 
and disgraced, sailed home again.&nbsp; Being afraid to go by the
English Channel, it sailed all round Scotland and Ireland; some 
of the ships getting cast away on the latter coast in bad 
weather, the Irish, who were a kind of savages, plundered those 
vessels and killed their crews.&nbsp; So ended this great attempt
to invade and conquer England.&nbsp; And I think it will be a 
long time before any other invincible fleet coming to England 
with the same object, will fare much better than the Spanish 
Armada.</p>
<p>Though the Spanish king had had this bitter taste of English 
bravery, he was so little the wiser for it, as still to entertain
his old designs, and even to conceive the absurd idea of placing 
his daughter on the English throne.&nbsp; But the Earl of Essex, 
<span class="smcap">Sir Walter Raleigh</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Sir Thomas Howard</span>, and some other 
distinguished leaders, put to sea from Plymouth, entered the port
of Cadiz once more, obtained a complete victory over the shipping
assembled there, and got possession of the town.&nbsp; In 
obedience to the Queen&rsquo;s express instructions, they behaved
with great humanity; and the principal loss of the Spaniards was 
a vast sum of money which they had to pay for ransom.&nbsp; This 
was one of many gallant achievements on the sea, effected in this
reign.&nbsp; Sir Walter Raleigh himself, after marrying a maid of
honour and giving offence to the Maiden Queen thereby, had 
already sailed to South America in search of gold.</p>
<p>The Earl of Leicester was now dead, and so was Sir Thomas 
Walsingham, whom Lord Burleigh was soon to follow.&nbsp; The 
principal favourite was the <span class="smcap">Earl of 
Essex</span>, a spirited and handsome man, a favourite with the 
people too as well as with the Queen, and possessed of many 
admirable qualities.&nbsp; It was much debated at Court whether 
there should be peace with Spain or no, and he was very urgent 
for war.&nbsp; He also tried hard to have his own way in the 
appointment of a deputy to govern in Ireland.&nbsp; One day, 
while this question was in dispute, he hastily took offence, and 
turned his back upon the Queen; as a gentle reminder of which 
impropriety, the Queen gave him a tremendous box on the ear, and 
told him to go to the devil.&nbsp; He went home instead, and did 
not reappear at Court for half a year or so, when he and the 
Queen were reconciled, though never (as some suppose) 
thoroughly.</p>
<p>From this time the fate of the Earl of Essex and that of the 
Queen seemed to be blended together.&nbsp; The Irish were still 
perpetually quarrelling and fighting among themselves, and he 
went over to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant, to the great joy of his 
enemies (Sir Walter Raleigh among the rest), who were glad to 
have so dangerous a rival far off.&nbsp; Not being by any means 
successful there, and knowing that his enemies would take 
advantage of that circumstance to injure him with the Queen, he 
came home again, though against her orders.&nbsp; The Queen being
taken by surprise when he appeared before her, gave him her hand 
to kiss, and he was overjoyed&mdash;though it was not a very 
lovely hand by this time&mdash;but in the course of the same day 
she ordered him to confine himself to his room, and two or three 
days afterwards had him taken into custody.&nbsp; With the same 
sort of caprice&mdash;and as capricious an old woman she now was,
as ever wore a crown or a head either&mdash;she sent him broth 
from her own table on his falling ill from anxiety, and cried 
about him.</p>
<p>He was a man who could find comfort and occupation in his 
books, and he did so for a time; not the least happy time, I dare
say, of his life.&nbsp; But it happened unfortunately for him, 
that he held a monopoly in sweet wines: which means that nobody 
could sell them without purchasing his permission.&nbsp; This 
right, which was only for a term, expiring, he applied to have it
renewed.&nbsp; The Queen refused, with the rather strong 
observation&mdash;but she <i>did</i> make strong 
observations&mdash;that an unruly beast must be stinted in his 
food.&nbsp; Upon this, the angry Earl, who had been already 
deprived of many offices, thought himself in danger of complete 
ruin, and turned against the Queen, whom he called a vain old 
woman who had grown as crooked in her mind as she had in her 
figure.&nbsp; These uncomplimentary expressions the ladies of the
Court immediately snapped up and carried to the Queen, whom they 
did not put in a better tempter, you may believe.&nbsp; The same 
Court ladies, when they had beautiful dark hair of their own, 
used to wear false red hair, to be like the Queen.&nbsp; So they 
were not very high-spirited ladies, however high in rank.</p>
<p>The worst object of the Earl of Essex, and some friends of his
who used to meet at <span class="smcap">Lord 
Southampton&rsquo;s</span> house, was to obtain possession of the
Queen, and oblige her by force to dismiss her ministers and 
change her favourites.&nbsp; On Saturday the seventh of February,
one thousand six hundred and one, the council suspecting this, 
summoned the Earl to come before them.&nbsp; He, pretending to be
ill, declined; it was then settled among his friends, that as the
next day would be Sunday, when many of the citizens usually 
assembled at the Cross by St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, he should 
make one bold effort to induce them to rise and follow him to the
Palace.</p>
<p>So, on the Sunday morning, he and a small body of adherents 
started out of his house&mdash;Essex House by the Strand, with 
steps to the river&mdash;having first shut up in it, as 
prisoners, some members of the council who came to examine 
him&mdash;and hurried into the City with the Earl at their head 
crying out &lsquo;For the Queen!&nbsp; For the Queen!&nbsp; A 
plot is laid for my life!&rsquo;&nbsp; No one heeded them, 
however, and when they came to St. Paul&rsquo;s there were no 
citizens there.&nbsp; In the meantime the prisoners at Essex 
House had been released by one of the Earl&rsquo;s own friends; 
he had been promptly proclaimed a traitor in the City itself; and
the streets were barricaded with carts and guarded by 
soldiers.&nbsp; The Earl got back to his house by water, with 
difficulty, and after an attempt to defend his house against the 
troops and cannon by which it was soon surrounded, gave himself 
up that night.&nbsp; He was brought to trial on the nineteenth, 
and found guilty; on the twenty-fifth, he was executed on Tower 
Hill, where he died, at thirty-four years old, both courageously 
and penitently.&nbsp; His step-father suffered with him.&nbsp; 
His enemy, Sir Walter Raleigh, stood near the scaffold all the 
time&mdash;but not so near it as we shall see him stand, before 
we finish his history.</p>
<p>In this case, as in the cases of the Duke of Norfolk and Mary 
Queen of Scots, the Queen had commanded, and countermanded, and 
again commanded, the execution.&nbsp; It is probable that the 
death of her young and gallant favourite in the prime of his good
qualities, was never off her mind afterwards, but she held out, 
the same vain, obstinate and capricious woman, for another 
year.&nbsp; Then she danced before her Court on a state 
occasion&mdash;and cut, I should think, a mighty ridiculous 
figure, doing so in an immense ruff, stomacher and wig, at 
seventy years old.&nbsp; For another year still, she held out, 
but, without any more dancing, and as a moody, sorrowful, broken 
creature.&nbsp; At last, on the tenth of March, one thousand six 
hundred and three, having been ill of a very bad cold, and made 
worse by the death of the Countess of Nottingham who was her 
intimate friend, she fell into a stupor and was supposed to be 
dead.&nbsp; She recovered her consciousness, however, and then 
nothing would induce her to go to bed; for she said that she knew
that if she did, she should never get up again.&nbsp; There she 
lay for ten days, on cushions on the floor, without any food, 
until the Lord Admiral got her into bed at last, partly by 
persuasions and partly by main force.&nbsp; When they asked her 
who should succeed her, she replied that her seat had been the 
seat of Kings, and that she would have for her successor, 
&lsquo;No rascal&rsquo;s son, but a King&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Upon this, the lords present stared at one another, and took the 
liberty of asking whom she meant; to which she replied, 
&lsquo;Whom should I mean, but our cousin of 
Scotland!&rsquo;&nbsp; This was on the twenty-third of 
March.&nbsp; They asked her once again that day, after she was 
speechless, whether she was still in the same mind?&nbsp; She 
struggled up in bed, and joined her hands over her head in the 
form of a crown, as the only reply she could make.&nbsp; At three
o&rsquo;clock next morning, she very quietly died, in the 
forty-fifth year of her reign.</p>
<p>That reign had been a glorious one, and is made for ever 
memorable by the distinguished men who flourished in it.&nbsp; 
Apart from the great voyagers, statesmen, and scholars, whom it 
produced, the names of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Spenser</span>, and <span 
class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>, will always be remembered with 
pride and veneration by the civilised world, and will always 
impart (though with no great reason, perhaps) some portion of 
their lustre to the name of Elizabeth herself.&nbsp; It was a 
great reign for discovery, for commerce, and for English 
enterprise and spirit in general.&nbsp; It was a great reign for 
the Protestant religion and for the Reformation which made 
England free.&nbsp; The Queen was very popular, and in her 
progresses, or journeys about her dominions, was everywhere 
received with the liveliest joy.&nbsp; I think the truth is, that
she was not half so good as she has been made out, and not half 
so bad as she has been made out.&nbsp; She had her fine 
qualities, but she was coarse, capricious, and treacherous, and 
had all the faults of an excessively vain young woman long after 
she was an old one.&nbsp; On the whole, she had a great deal too 
much of her father in her, to please me.</p>
<p>Many improvements and luxuries were introduced in the course 
of these five-and-forty years in the general manner of living; 
but cock-fighting, bull-baiting, and bear-baiting, were still the
national amusements; and a coach was so rarely seen, and was such
an ugly and cumbersome affair when it was seen, that even the 
Queen herself, on many high occasions, rode on horseback on a 
pillion behind the Lord Chancellor.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE FIRST</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Our cousin of Scotland&rsquo; was ugly, awkward, and 
shuffling both in mind and person.&nbsp; His tongue was much too 
large for his mouth, his legs were much too weak for his body, 
and his dull goggle-eyes stared and rolled like an 
idiot&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was cunning, covetous, wasteful, idle, 
drunken, greedy, dirty, cowardly, a great swearer, and the most 
conceited man on earth.&nbsp; His figure&mdash;what is commonly 
called rickety from his birth&mdash;presented a most ridiculous 
appearance, dressed in thick padded clothes, as a safeguard 
against being stabbed (of which he lived in continual fear), of a
grass-green colour from head to foot, with a hunting-horn 
dangling at his side instead of a sword, and his hat and feather 
sticking over one eye, or hanging on the back of his head, as he 
happened to toss it on.&nbsp; He used to loll on the necks of his
favourite courtiers, and slobber their faces, and kiss and pinch 
their cheeks; and the greatest favourite he ever had, used to 
sign himself in his letters to his royal master, His 
Majesty&rsquo;s &lsquo;dog and slave,&rsquo; and used to address 
his majesty as &lsquo;his Sowship.&rsquo;&nbsp; His majesty was 
the worst rider ever seen, and thought himself the best.&nbsp; He
was one of the most impertinent talkers (in the broadest Scotch) 
ever heard, and boasted of being unanswerable in all manner of 
argument.&nbsp; He wrote some of the most wearisome treatises 
ever read&mdash;among others, a book upon witchcraft, in which he
was a devout believer&mdash;and thought himself a prodigy of 
authorship.&nbsp; He thought, and wrote, and said, that a king 
had a right to make and unmake what laws he pleased, and ought to
be accountable to nobody on earth.&nbsp; This is the plain, true 
character of the personage whom the greatest men about the court 
praised and flattered to that degree, that I doubt if there be 
anything much more shameful in the annals of human nature.</p>
<p>He came to the English throne with great ease.&nbsp; The 
miseries of a disputed succession had been felt so long, and so 
dreadfully, that he was proclaimed within a few hours of 
Elizabeth&rsquo;s death, and was accepted by the nation, even 
without being asked to give any pledge that he would govern well,
or that he would redress crying grievances.&nbsp; He took a month
to come from Edinburgh to London; and, by way of exercising his 
new power, hanged a pickpocket on the journey without any trial, 
and knighted everybody he could lay hold of.&nbsp; He made two 
hundred knights before he got to his palace in London, and seven 
hundred before he had been in it three months.&nbsp; He also 
shovelled sixty-two new peers into the House of Lords&mdash;and 
there was a pretty large sprinkling of Scotchmen among them, you 
may believe.</p>
<p>His Sowship&rsquo;s prime Minister, <span 
class="smcap">Cecil</span> (for I cannot do better than call his 
majesty what his favourite called him), was the enemy of Sir 
Walter Raleigh, and also of Sir Walter&rsquo;s political friend, 
<span class="smcap">Lord Cobham</span>; and his Sowship&rsquo;s 
first trouble was a plot originated by these two, and entered 
into by some others, with the old object of seizing the King and 
keeping him in imprisonment until he should change his 
ministers.&nbsp; There were Catholic priests in the plot, and 
there were Puritan noblemen too; for, although the Catholics and 
Puritans were strongly opposed to each other, they united at this
time against his Sowship, because they knew that he had a design 
against both, after pretending to be friendly to each; this 
design being to have only one high and convenient form of the 
Protestant religion, which everybody should be bound to belong 
to, whether they liked it or not.&nbsp; This plot was mixed up 
with another, which may or may not have had some reference to 
placing on the throne, at some time, the <span class="smcap">Lady
Arabella Stuart</span>; whose misfortune it was, to be the 
daughter of the younger brother of his Sowship&rsquo;s father, 
but who was quite innocent of any part in the scheme.&nbsp; Sir 
Walter Raleigh was accused on the confession of Lord 
Cobham&mdash;a miserable creature, who said one thing at one 
time, and another thing at another time, and could be relied upon
in nothing.&nbsp; The trial of Sir Walter Raleigh lasted from 
eight in the morning until nearly midnight; he defended himself 
with such eloquence, genius, and spirit against all accusations, 
and against the insults of <span class="smcap">Coke</span>, the 
Attorney-General&mdash;who, according to the custom of the time, 
foully abused him&mdash;that those who went there detesting the 
prisoner, came away admiring him, and declaring that anything so 
wonderful and so captivating was never heard.&nbsp; He was found 
guilty, nevertheless, and sentenced to death.&nbsp; Execution was
deferred, and he was taken to the Tower.&nbsp; The two Catholic 
priests, less fortunate, were executed with the usual atrocity; 
and Lord Cobham and two others were pardoned on the 
scaffold.&nbsp; His Sowship thought it wonderfully knowing in him
to surprise the people by pardoning these three at the very 
block; but, blundering, and bungling, as usual, he had very 
nearly overreached himself.&nbsp; For, the messenger on horseback
who brought the pardon, came so late, that he was pushed to the 
outside of the crowd, and was obliged to shout and roar out what 
he came for.&nbsp; The miserable Cobham did not gain much by 
being spared that day.&nbsp; He lived, both as a prisoner and a 
beggar, utterly despised, and miserably poor, for thirteen years,
and then died in an old outhouse belonging to one of his former 
servants.</p>
<p>This plot got rid of, and Sir Walter Raleigh safely shut up in
the Tower, his Sowship held a great dispute with the Puritans on 
their presenting a petition to him, and had it all his own 
way&mdash;not so very wonderful, as he would talk continually, 
and would not hear anybody else&mdash;and filled the Bishops with
admiration.&nbsp; It was comfortably settled that there was to be
only one form of religion, and that all men were to think exactly
alike.&nbsp; But, although this was arranged two centuries and a 
half ago, and although the arrangement was supported by much 
fining and imprisonment, I do not find that it is quite 
successful, even yet.</p>
<p>His Sowship, having that uncommonly high opinion of himself as
a king, had a very low opinion of Parliament as a power that 
audaciously wanted to control him.&nbsp; When he called his first
Parliament after he had been king a year, he accordingly thought 
he would take pretty high ground with them, and told them that he
commanded them &lsquo;as an absolute king.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
Parliament thought those strong words, and saw the necessity of 
upholding their authority.&nbsp; His Sowship had three children: 
Prince Henry, Prince Charles, and the Princess Elizabeth.&nbsp; 
It would have been well for one of these, and we shall too soon 
see which, if he had learnt a little wisdom concerning 
Parliaments from his father&rsquo;s obstinacy.</p>
<p>Now, the people still labouring under their old dread of the 
Catholic religion, this Parliament revived and strengthened the 
severe laws against it.&nbsp; And this so angered <span 
class="smcap">Robert Catesby</span>, a restless Catholic 
gentleman of an old family, that he formed one of the most 
desperate and terrible designs ever conceived in the mind of man;
no less a scheme than the Gunpowder Plot.</p>
<p>His object was, when the King, lords, and commons, should be 
assembled at the next opening of Parliament, to blow them up, one
and all, with a great mine of gunpowder.&nbsp; The first person 
to whom he confided this horrible idea was <span 
class="smcap">Thomas Winter</span>, a Worcestershire gentleman 
who had served in the army abroad, and had been secretly employed
in Catholic projects.&nbsp; While Winter was yet undecided, and 
when he had gone over to the Netherlands, to learn from the 
Spanish Ambassador there whether there was any hope of Catholics 
being relieved through the intercession of the King of Spain with
his Sowship, he found at Ostend a tall, dark, daring man, whom he
had known when they were both soldiers abroad, and whose name was
<span class="smcap">Guido</span>&mdash;or <span 
class="smcap">Guy</span>&mdash;<span 
class="smcap">Fawkes</span>.&nbsp; Resolved to join the plot, he 
proposed it to this man, knowing him to be the man for any 
desperate deed, and they two came back to England together.&nbsp;
Here, they admitted two other conspirators; <span 
class="smcap">Thomas Percy</span>, related to the Earl of 
Northumberland, and <span class="smcap">John Wright</span>, his 
brother-in-law.&nbsp; All these met together in a solitary house 
in the open fields which were then near Clement&rsquo;s Inn, now 
a closely blocked-up part of London; and when they had all taken 
a great oath of secrecy, Catesby told the rest what his plan 
was.&nbsp; They then went up-stairs into a garret, and received 
the Sacrament from <span class="smcap">Father Gerard</span>, a 
Jesuit, who is said not to have known actually of the Gunpowder 
Plot, but who, I think, must have had his suspicions that there 
was something desperate afoot.</p>
<p>Percy was a Gentleman Pensioner, and as he had occasional 
duties to perform about the Court, then kept at Whitehall, there 
would be nothing suspicious in his living at Westminster.&nbsp; 
So, having looked well about him, and having found a house to 
let, the back of which joined the Parliament House, he hired it 
of a person named <span class="smcap">Ferris</span>, for the 
purpose of undermining the wall.&nbsp; Having got possession of 
this house, the conspirators hired another on the Lambeth side of
the Thames, which they used as a storehouse for wood, gunpowder, 
and other combustible matters.&nbsp; These were to be removed at 
night (and afterwards were removed), bit by bit, to the house at 
Westminster; and, that there might be some trusty person to keep 
watch over the Lambeth stores, they admitted another conspirator,
by name <span class="smcap">Robert Kay</span>, a very poor 
Catholic gentleman.</p>
<p>All these arrangements had been made some months, and it was a
dark, wintry, December night, when the conspirators, who had been
in the meantime dispersed to avoid observation, met in the house 
at Westminster, and began to dig.&nbsp; They had laid in a good 
stock of eatables, to avoid going in and out, and they dug and 
dug with great ardour.&nbsp; But, the wall being tremendously 
thick, and the work very severe, they took into their plot <span 
class="smcap">Christopher Wright</span>, a younger brother of 
John Wright, that they might have a new pair of hands to 
help.&nbsp; And Christopher Wright fell to like a fresh man, and 
they dug and dug by night and by day, and Fawkes stood sentinel 
all the time.&nbsp; And if any man&rsquo;s heart seemed to fail 
him at all, Fawkes said, &lsquo;Gentlemen, we have abundance of 
powder and shot here, and there is no fear of our being taken 
alive, even if discovered.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same Fawkes, who, in 
the capacity of sentinel, was always prowling about, soon picked 
up the intelligence that the King had prorogued the Parliament 
again, from the seventh of February, the day first fixed upon, 
until the third of October.&nbsp; When the conspirators knew 
this, they agreed to separate until after the Christmas holidays,
and to take no notice of each other in the meanwhile, and never 
to write letters to one another on any account.&nbsp; So, the 
house in Westminster was shut up again, and I suppose the 
neighbours thought that those strange-looking men who lived there
so gloomily, and went out so seldom, were gone away to have a 
merry Christmas somewhere.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of February, sixteen hundred and five, 
when Catesby met his fellow-conspirators again at this 
Westminster house.&nbsp; He had now admitted three more; <span 
class="smcap">John Grant</span>, a Warwickshire gentleman of a 
melancholy temper, who lived in a doleful house near 
Stratford-upon-Avon, with a frowning wall all round it, and a 
deep moat; <span class="smcap">Robert Winter</span>, eldest 
brother of Thomas; and Catesby&rsquo;s own servant, <span 
class="smcap">Thomas Bates</span>, who, Catesby thought, had had 
some suspicion of what his master was about.&nbsp; These three 
had all suffered more or less for their religion in 
Elizabeth&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; And now, they all began to dig 
again, and they dug and dug by night and by day.</p>
<p>They found it dismal work alone there, underground, with such 
a fearful secret on their minds, and so many murders before 
them.&nbsp; They were filled with wild fancies.&nbsp; Sometimes, 
they thought they heard a great bell tolling, deep down in the 
earth under the Parliament House; sometimes, they thought they 
heard low voices muttering about the Gunpowder Plot; once in the 
morning, they really did hear a great rumbling noise over their 
heads, as they dug and sweated in their mine.&nbsp; Every man 
stopped and looked aghast at his neighbour, wondering what had 
happened, when that bold prowler, Fawkes, who had been out to 
look, came in and told them that it was only a dealer in coals 
who had occupied a cellar under the Parliament House, removing 
his stock in trade to some other place.&nbsp; Upon this, the 
conspirators, who with all their digging and digging had not yet 
dug through the tremendously thick wall, changed their plan; 
hired that cellar, which was directly under the House of Lords; 
put six-and-thirty barrels of gunpowder in it, and covered them 
over with fagots and coals.&nbsp; Then they all dispersed again 
till September, when the following new conspirators were 
admitted; <span class="smcap">Sir Edward Baynham</span>, of 
Gloucestershire; <span class="smcap">Sir Everard Digby</span>, of
Rutlandshire; <span class="smcap">Ambrose Rookwood</span>, of 
Suffolk; <span class="smcap">Francis Tresham</span>, of 
Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Most of these were rich, and were to 
assist the plot, some with money and some with horses on which 
the conspirators were to ride through the country and rouse the 
Catholics after the Parliament should be blown into air.</p>
<p>Parliament being again prorogued from the third of October to 
the fifth of November, and the conspirators being uneasy lest 
their design should have been found out, Thomas Winter said he 
would go up into the House of Lords on the day of the 
prorogation, and see how matters looked.&nbsp; Nothing could be 
better.&nbsp; The unconscious Commissioners were walking about 
and talking to one another, just over the six-and-thirty barrels 
of gunpowder.&nbsp; He came back and told the rest so, and they 
went on with their preparations.&nbsp; They hired a ship, and 
kept it ready in the Thames, in which Fawkes was to sail for 
Flanders after firing with a slow match the train that was to 
explode the powder.&nbsp; A number of Catholic gentlemen not in 
the secret, were invited, on pretence of a hunting party, to meet
Sir Everard Digby at Dunchurch on the fatal day, that they might 
be ready to act together.&nbsp; And now all was ready.</p>
<p>But, now, the great wickedness and danger which had been all 
along at the bottom of this wicked plot, began to show 
itself.&nbsp; As the fifth of November drew near, most of the 
conspirators, remembering that they had friends and relations who
would be in the House of Lords that day, felt some natural 
relenting, and a wish to warn them to keep away.&nbsp; They were 
not much comforted by Catesby&rsquo;s declaring that in such a 
cause he would blow up his own son.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Lord Mounteagle</span>, Tresham&rsquo;s 
brother-in-law, was certain to be in the house; and when Tresham 
found that he could not prevail upon the rest to devise any means
of sparing their friends, he wrote a mysterious letter to this 
lord and left it at his lodging in the dusk, urging him to keep 
away from the opening of Parliament, &lsquo;since God and man had
concurred to punish the wickedness of the times.&rsquo;&nbsp; It 
contained the words &lsquo;that the Parliament should receive a 
terrible blow, and yet should not see who hurt them.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And it added, &lsquo;the danger is past, as soon as you have 
burnt the letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ministers and courtiers made out that his Sowship, by a 
direct miracle from Heaven, found out what this letter 
meant.&nbsp; The truth is, that they were not long (as few men 
would be) in finding out for themselves; and it was decided to 
let the conspirators alone, until the very day before the opening
of Parliament.&nbsp; That the conspirators had their fears, is 
certain; for, Tresham himself said before them all, that they 
were every one dead men; and, although even he did not take 
flight, there is reason to suppose that he had warned other 
persons besides Lord Mounteagle.&nbsp; However, they were all 
firm; and Fawkes, who was a man of iron, went down every day and 
night to keep watch in the cellar as usual.&nbsp; He was there 
about two in the afternoon of the fourth, when the Lord 
Chamberlain and Lord Mounteagle threw open the door and looked 
in.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who are you, friend?&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Fawkes, &lsquo;I am Mr. Percy&rsquo;s 
servant, and am looking after his store of fuel 
here.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your master has laid in a pretty good 
store,&rsquo; they returned, and shut the door, and went 
away.&nbsp; Fawkes, upon this, posted off to the other 
conspirators to tell them all was quiet, and went back and shut 
himself up in the dark, black cellar again, where he heard the 
bell go twelve o&rsquo;clock and usher in the fifth of 
November.&nbsp; About two hours afterwards, he slowly opened the 
door, and came out to look about him, in his old prowling 
way.&nbsp; He was instantly seized and bound, by a party of 
soldiers under <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas 
Knevett</span>.&nbsp; He had a watch upon him, some touchwood, 
some tinder, some slow matches; and there was a dark lantern with
a candle in it, lighted, behind the door.&nbsp; He had his boots 
and spurs on&mdash;to ride to the ship, I suppose&mdash;and it 
was well for the soldiers that they took him so suddenly.&nbsp; 
If they had left him but a moment&rsquo;s time to light a match, 
he certainly would have tossed it in among the powder, and blown 
up himself and them.</p>
<p>They took him to the King&rsquo;s bed-chamber first of all, 
and there the King (causing him to be held very tight, and 
keeping a good way off), asked him how he could have the heart to
intend to destroy so many innocent people?&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said Guy Fawkes, &lsquo;desperate diseases
need desperate remedies.&rsquo;&nbsp; To a little Scotch 
favourite, with a face like a terrier, who asked him (with no 
particular wisdom) why he had collected so much gunpowder, he 
replied, because he had meant to blow Scotchmen back to Scotland,
and it would take a deal of powder to do that.&nbsp; Next day he 
was carried to the Tower, but would make no confession.&nbsp; 
Even after being horribly tortured, he confessed nothing that the
Government did not already know; though he must have been in a 
fearful state&mdash;as his signature, still preserved, in 
contrast with his natural hand-writing before he was put upon the
dreadful rack, most frightfully shows.&nbsp; Bates, a very 
different man, soon said the Jesuits had had to do with the plot,
and probably, under the torture, would as readily have said 
anything.&nbsp; Tresham, taken and put in the Tower too, made 
confessions and unmade them, and died of an illness that was 
heavy upon him.&nbsp; Rookwood, who had stationed relays of his 
own horses all the way to Dunchurch, did not mount to escape 
until the middle of the day, when the news of the plot was all 
over London.&nbsp; On the road, he came up with the two Wrights, 
Catesby, and Percy; and they all galloped together into 
Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Thence to Dunchurch, where they found the
proposed party assembled.&nbsp; Finding, however, that there had 
been a plot, and that it had been discovered, the party 
disappeared in the course of the night, and left them alone with 
Sir Everard Digby.&nbsp; Away they all rode again, through 
Warwickshire and Worcestershire, to a house called Holbeach, on 
the borders of Staffordshire.&nbsp; They tried to raise the 
Catholics on their way, but were indignantly driven off by 
them.&nbsp; All this time they were hotly pursued by the sheriff 
of Worcester, and a fast increasing concourse of riders.&nbsp; At
last, resolving to defend themselves at Holbeach, they shut 
themselves up in the house, and put some wet powder before the 
fire to dry.&nbsp; But it blew up, and Catesby was singed and 
blackened, and almost killed, and some of the others were sadly 
hurt.&nbsp; Still, knowing that they must die, they resolved to 
die there, and with only their swords in their hands appeared at 
the windows to be shot at by the sheriff and his 
assistants.&nbsp; Catesby said to Thomas Winter, after Thomas had
been hit in the right arm which dropped powerless by his side, 
&lsquo;Stand by me, Tom, and we will die 
together!&rsquo;&mdash;which they did, being shot through the 
body by two bullets from one gun.&nbsp; John Wright, and 
Christopher Wright, and Percy, were also shot.&nbsp; Rookwood and
Digby were taken: the former with a broken arm and a wound in his
body too.</p>
<p>It was the fifteenth of January, before the trial of Guy 
Fawkes, and such of the other conspirators as were left alive, 
came on.&nbsp; They were all found guilty, all hanged, drawn, and
quartered: some, in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, on the top of 
Ludgate-hill; some, before the Parliament House.&nbsp; A Jesuit 
priest, named <span class="smcap">Henry Garnet</span>, to whom 
the dreadful design was said to have been communicated, was taken
and tried; and two of his servants, as well as a poor priest who 
was taken with him, were tortured without mercy.&nbsp; He himself
was not tortured, but was surrounded in the Tower by tamperers 
and traitors, and so was made unfairly to convict himself out of 
his own mouth.&nbsp; He said, upon his trial, that he had done 
all he could to prevent the deed, and that he could not make 
public what had been told him in confession&mdash;though I am 
afraid he knew of the plot in other ways.&nbsp; He was found 
guilty and executed, after a manful defence, and the Catholic 
Church made a saint of him; some rich and powerful persons, who 
had had nothing to do with the project, were fined and imprisoned
for it by the Star Chamber; the Catholics, in general, who had 
recoiled with horror from the idea of the infernal contrivance, 
were unjustly put under more severe laws than before; and this 
was the end of the Gunpowder Plot.</p>
<h3>SECOND PART</h3>
<p>His Sowship would pretty willingly, I think, have blown the 
House of Commons into the air himself; for, his dread and 
jealousy of it knew no bounds all through his reign.&nbsp; When 
he was hard pressed for money he was obliged to order it to meet,
as he could get no money without it; and when it asked him first 
to abolish some of the monopolies in necessaries of life which 
were a great grievance to the people, and to redress other public
wrongs, he flew into a rage and got rid of it again.&nbsp; At one
time he wanted it to consent to the Union of England with 
Scotland, and quarrelled about that.&nbsp; At another time it 
wanted him to put down a most infamous Church abuse, called the 
High Commission Court, and he quarrelled with it about 
that.&nbsp; At another time it entreated him not to be quite so 
fond of his archbishops and bishops who made speeches in his 
praise too awful to be related, but to have some little 
consideration for the poor Puritan clergy who were persecuted for
preaching in their own way, and not according to the archbishops 
and bishops; and they quarrelled about that.&nbsp; In short, what
with hating the House of Commons, and pretending not to hate it; 
and what with now sending some of its members who opposed him, to
Newgate or to the Tower, and now telling the rest that they must 
not presume to make speeches about the public affairs which could
not possibly concern them; and what with cajoling, and bullying, 
and fighting, and being frightened; the House of Commons was the 
plague of his Sowship&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; It was pretty 
firm, however, in maintaining its rights, and insisting that the 
Parliament should make the laws, and not the King by his own 
single proclamations (which he tried hard to do); and his Sowship
was so often distressed for money, in consequence, that he sold 
every sort of title and public office as if they were 
merchandise, and even invented a new dignity called a Baronetcy, 
which anybody could buy for a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>These disputes with his Parliaments, and his hunting, and his 
drinking, and his lying in bed&mdash;for he was a great 
sluggard&mdash;occupied his Sowship pretty well.&nbsp; The rest 
of his time he chiefly passed in hugging and slobbering his 
favourites.&nbsp; The first of these was <span class="smcap">Sir 
Philip Herbert</span>, who had no knowledge whatever, except of 
dogs, and horses, and hunting, but whom he soon made <span 
class="smcap">Earl of Montgomery</span>.&nbsp; The next, and a 
much more famous one, was <span class="smcap">Robert Carr</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Ker</span> (for it is not certain which 
was his right name), who came from the Border country, and whom 
he soon made <span class="smcap">Viscount Rochester</span>, and 
afterwards, <span class="smcap">Earl of Somerset</span>.&nbsp; 
The way in which his Sowship doted on this handsome young man, is
even more odious to think of, than the way in which the really 
great men of England condescended to bow down before him.&nbsp; 
The favourite&rsquo;s great friend was a certain <span 
class="smcap">Sir Thomas Overbury</span>, who wrote his 
love-letters for him, and assisted him in the duties of his many 
high places, which his own ignorance prevented him from 
discharging.&nbsp; But this same Sir Thomas having just manhood 
enough to dissuade the favourite from a wicked marriage with the 
beautiful Countess of Essex, who was to get a divorce from her 
husband for the purpose, the said Countess, in her rage, got Sir 
Thomas put into the Tower, and there poisoned him.&nbsp; Then the
favourite and this bad woman were publicly married by the 
King&rsquo;s pet bishop, with as much to-do and rejoicing, as if 
he had been the best man, and she the best woman, upon the face 
of the earth.</p>
<p>But, after a longer sunshine than might have been 
expected&mdash;of seven years or so, that is to say&mdash;another
handsome young man started up and eclipsed the <span 
class="smcap">Earl of Somerset</span>.&nbsp; This was <span 
class="smcap">George Villiers</span>, the youngest son of a 
Leicestershire gentleman: who came to Court with all the Paris 
fashions on him, and could dance as well as the best mountebank 
that ever was seen.&nbsp; He soon danced himself into the good 
graces of his Sowship, and danced the other favourite out of 
favour.&nbsp; Then, it was all at once discovered that the Earl 
and Countess of Somerset had not deserved all those great 
promotions and mighty rejoicings, and they were separately tried 
for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and for other 
crimes.&nbsp; But, the King was so afraid of his late 
favourite&rsquo;s publicly telling some disgraceful things he 
knew of him&mdash;which he darkly threatened to do&mdash;that he 
was even examined with two men standing, one on either side of 
him, each with a cloak in his hand, ready to throw it over his 
head and stop his mouth if he should break out with what he had 
it in his power to tell.&nbsp; So, a very lame affair was 
purposely made of the trial, and his punishment was an allowance 
of four thousand pounds a year in retirement, while the Countess 
was pardoned, and allowed to pass into retirement too.&nbsp; They
hated one another by this time, and lived to revile and torment 
each other some years.</p>
<p>While these events were in progress, and while his Sowship was
making such an exhibition of himself, from day to day and from 
year to year, as is not often seen in any sty, three remarkable 
deaths took place in England.&nbsp; The first was that of the 
Minister, Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, who was past sixty, 
and had never been strong, being deformed from his birth.&nbsp; 
He said at last that he had no wish to live; and no Minister need
have had, with his experience of the meanness and wickedness of 
those disgraceful times.&nbsp; The second was that of the Lady 
Arabella Stuart, who alarmed his Sowship mightily, by privately 
marrying <span class="smcap">William Seymour</span>, son of <span
class="smcap">Lord Beauchamp</span>, who was a descendant of King
Henry the Seventh, and who, his Sowship thought, might 
consequently increase and strengthen any claim she might one day 
set up to the throne.&nbsp; She was separated from her husband 
(who was put in the Tower) and thrust into a boat to be confined 
at Durham.&nbsp; She escaped in a man&rsquo;s dress to get away 
in a French ship from Gravesend to France, but unhappily missed 
her husband, who had escaped too, and was soon taken.&nbsp; She 
went raving mad in the miserable Tower, and died there after four
years.&nbsp; The last, and the most important of these three 
deaths, was that of Prince Henry, the heir to the throne, in the 
nineteenth year of his age.&nbsp; He was a promising young 
prince, and greatly liked; a quiet, well-conducted youth, of whom
two very good things are known: first, that his father was 
jealous of him; secondly, that he was the friend of Sir Walter 
Raleigh, languishing through all those years in the Tower, and 
often said that no man but his father would keep such a bird in 
such a cage.&nbsp; On the occasion of the preparations for the 
marriage of his sister the Princess Elizabeth with a foreign 
prince (and an unhappy marriage it turned out), he came from 
Richmond, where he had been very ill, to greet his new 
brother-in-law, at the palace at Whitehall.&nbsp; There he played
a great game at tennis, in his shirt, though it was very cold 
weather, and was seized with an alarming illness, and died within
a fortnight of a putrid fever.&nbsp; For this young prince Sir 
Walter Raleigh wrote, in his prison in the Tower, the beginning 
of a History of the World: a wonderful instance how little his 
Sowship could do to confine a great man&rsquo;s mind, however 
long he might imprison his body.</p>
<p>And this mention of Sir Walter Raleigh, who had many faults, 
but who never showed so many merits as in trouble and adversity, 
may bring me at once to the end of his sad story.&nbsp; After an 
imprisonment in the Tower of twelve long years, he proposed to 
resume those old sea voyages of his, and to go to South America 
in search of gold.&nbsp; His Sowship, divided between his wish to
be on good terms with the Spaniards through whose territory Sir 
Walter must pass (he had long had an idea of marrying Prince 
Henry to a Spanish Princess), and his avaricious eagerness to get
hold of the gold, did not know what to do.&nbsp; But, in the end,
he set Sir Walter free, taking securities for his return; and Sir
Walter fitted out an expedition at his own coast and, on the 
twenty-eighth of March, one thousand six hundred and seventeen, 
sailed away in command of one of its ships, which he ominously 
called the Destiny.&nbsp; The expedition failed; the common men, 
not finding the gold they had expected, mutinied; a quarrel broke
out between Sir Walter and the Spaniards, who hated him for old 
successes of his against them; and he took and burnt a little 
town called <span class="smcap">Saint Thomas</span>.&nbsp; For 
this he was denounced to his Sowship by the Spanish Ambassador as
a pirate; and returning almost broken-hearted, with his hopes and
fortunes shattered, his company of friends dispersed, and his 
brave son (who had been one of them) killed, he was 
taken&mdash;through the treachery of <span class="smcap">Sir 
Lewis Stukely</span>, his near relation, a scoundrel and a 
Vice-Admiral&mdash;and was once again immured in his prison-home 
of so many years.</p>
<p>His Sowship being mightily disappointed in not getting any 
gold, Sir Walter Raleigh was tried as unfairly, and with as many 
lies and evasions as the judges and law officers and every other 
authority in Church and State habitually practised under such a 
King.&nbsp; After a great deal of prevarication on all parts but 
his own, it was declared that he must die under his former 
sentence, now fifteen years old.&nbsp; So, on the twenty-eighth 
of October, one thousand six hundred and eighteen, he was shut up
in the Gate House at Westminster to pass his late night on earth,
and there he took leave of his good and faithful lady who was 
worthy to have lived in better days.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock
next morning, after a cheerful breakfast, and a pipe, and a cup 
of good wine, he was taken to Old Palace Yard in Westminster, 
where the scaffold was set up, and where so many people of high 
degree were assembled to see him die, that it was a matter of 
some difficulty to get him through the crowd.&nbsp; He behaved 
most nobly, but if anything lay heavy on his mind, it was that 
Earl of Essex, whose head he had seen roll off; and he solemnly 
said that he had had no hand in bringing him to the block, and 
that he had shed tears for him when he died.&nbsp; As the morning
was very cold, the Sheriff said, would he come down to a fire for
a little space, and warm himself?&nbsp; But Sir Walter thanked 
him, and said no, he would rather it were done at once, for he 
was ill of fever and ague, and in another quarter of an hour his 
shaking fit would come upon him if he were still alive, and his 
enemies might then suppose that he trembled for fear.&nbsp; With 
that, he kneeled and made a very beautiful and Christian 
prayer.&nbsp; Before he laid his head upon the block he felt the 
edge of the axe, and said, with a smile upon his face, that it 
was a sharp medicine, but would cure the worst disease.&nbsp; 
When he was bent down ready for death, he said to the 
executioner, finding that he hesitated, &lsquo;What dost thou 
fear?&nbsp; Strike, man!&rsquo;&nbsp; So, the axe came down and 
struck his head off, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.</p>
<p>The new favourite got on fast.&nbsp; He was made a viscount, 
he was made Duke of Buckingham, he was made a marquis, he was 
made Master of the Horse, he was made Lord High Admiral&mdash;and
the Chief Commander of the gallant English forces that had 
dispersed the Spanish Armada, was displaced to make room for 
him.&nbsp; He had the whole kingdom at his disposal, and his 
mother sold all the profits and honours of the State, as if she 
had kept a shop.&nbsp; He blazed all over with diamonds and other
precious stones, from his hatband and his earrings to his 
shoes.&nbsp; Yet he was an ignorant presumptuous, swaggering 
compound of knave and fool, with nothing but his beauty and his 
dancing to recommend him.&nbsp; This is the gentleman who called 
himself his Majesty&rsquo;s dog and slave, and called his Majesty
Your Sowship.&nbsp; His Sowship called him <span 
class="smcap">Steenie</span>; it is supposed, because that was a 
nickname for Stephen, and because St. Stephen was generally 
represented in pictures as a handsome saint.</p>
<p>His Sowship was driven sometimes to his wits&rsquo;-end by his
trimming between the general dislike of the Catholic religion at 
home, and his desire to wheedle and flatter it abroad, as his 
only means of getting a rich princess for his son&rsquo;s wife: a
part of whose fortune he might cram into his greasy 
pockets.&nbsp; Prince Charles&mdash;or as his Sowship called him,
Baby Charles&mdash;being now <span class="smcap">Prince of 
Wales</span>, the old project of a marriage with the Spanish 
King&rsquo;s daughter had been revived for him; and as she could 
not marry a Protestant without leave from the Pope, his Sowship 
himself secretly and meanly wrote to his Infallibility, asking 
for it.&nbsp; The negotiation for this Spanish marriage takes up 
a larger space in great books, than you can imagine, but the 
upshot of it all is, that when it had been held off by the 
Spanish Court for a long time, Baby Charles and Steenie set off 
in disguise as Mr. Thomas Smith and Mr. John Smith, to see the 
Spanish Princess; that Baby Charles pretended to be desperately 
in love with her, and jumped off walls to look at her, and made a
considerable fool of himself in a good many ways; that she was 
called Princess of Wales and that the whole Spanish Court 
believed Baby Charles to be all but dying for her sake, as he 
expressly told them he was; that Baby Charles and Steenie came 
back to England, and were received with as much rapture as if 
they had been a blessing to it; that Baby Charles had actually 
fallen in love with <span class="smcap">Henrietta Maria</span>, 
the French King&rsquo;s sister, whom he had seen in Paris; that 
he thought it a wonderfully fine and princely thing to have 
deceived the Spaniards, all through; and that he openly said, 
with a chuckle, as soon as he was safe and sound at home again, 
that the Spaniards were great fools to have believed him.</p>
<p>Like most dishonest men, the Prince and the favourite 
complained that the people whom they had deluded were 
dishonest.&nbsp; They made such misrepresentations of the 
treachery of the Spaniards in this business of the Spanish match,
that the English nation became eager for a war with them.&nbsp; 
Although the gravest Spaniards laughed at the idea of his Sowship
in a warlike attitude, the Parliament granted money for the 
beginning of hostilities, and the treaties with Spain were 
publicly declared to be at an end.&nbsp; The Spanish ambassador 
in London&mdash;probably with the help of the fallen favourite, 
the Earl of Somerset&mdash;being unable to obtain speech with his
Sowship, slipped a paper into his hand, declaring that he was a 
prisoner in his own house, and was entirely governed by 
Buckingham and his creatures.&nbsp; The first effect of this 
letter was that his Sowship began to cry and whine, and took Baby
Charles away from Steenie, and went down to Windsor, gabbling all
sorts of nonsense.&nbsp; The end of it was that his Sowship 
hugged his dog and slave, and said he was quite satisfied.</p>
<p>He had given the Prince and the favourite almost unlimited 
power to settle anything with the Pope as to the Spanish 
marriage; and he now, with a view to the French one, signed a 
treaty that all Roman Catholics in England should exercise their 
religion freely, and should never be required to take any oath 
contrary thereto.&nbsp; In return for this, and for other 
concessions much less to be defended, Henrietta Maria was to 
become the Prince&rsquo;s wife, and was to bring him a fortune of
eight hundred thousand crowns.</p>
<p>His Sowship&rsquo;s eyes were getting red with eagerly looking
for the money, when the end of a gluttonous life came upon him; 
and, after a fortnight&rsquo;s illness, on Sunday the 
twenty-seventh of March, one thousand six hundred and 
twenty-five, he died.&nbsp; He had reigned twenty-two years, and 
was fifty-nine years old.&nbsp; I know of nothing more abominable
in history than the adulation that was lavished on this King, and
the vice and corruption that such a barefaced habit of lying 
produced in his court.&nbsp; It is much to be doubted whether one
man of honour, and not utterly self-disgraced, kept his place 
near James the First.&nbsp; Lord Bacon, that able and wise 
philosopher, as the First Judge in the Kingdom in this reign, 
became a public spectacle of dishonesty and corruption; and in 
his base flattery of his Sowship, and in his crawling servility 
to his dog and slave, disgraced himself even more.&nbsp; But, a 
creature like his Sowship set upon a throne is like the Plague, 
and everybody receives infection from him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST</h2>
<p>Baby Charles became <span class="smcap">King Charles the 
First</span>, in the twenty-fifth year of his age.&nbsp; Unlike 
his father, he was usually amiable in his private character, and 
grave and dignified in his bearing; but, like his father, he had 
monstrously exaggerated notions of the rights of a king, and was 
evasive, and not to be trusted.&nbsp; If his word could have been
relied upon, his history might have had a different end.</p>
<p>His first care was to send over that insolent upstart, 
Buckingham, to bring Henrietta Maria from Paris to be his Queen; 
upon which occasion Buckingham&mdash;with his usual 
audacity&mdash;made love to the young Queen of Austria, and was 
very indignant indeed with <span class="smcap">Cardinal 
Richelieu</span>, the French Minister, for thwarting his 
intentions.&nbsp; The English people were very well disposed to 
like their new Queen, and to receive her with great favour when 
she came among them as a stranger.&nbsp; But, she held the 
Protestant religion in great dislike, and brought over a crowd of
unpleasant priests, who made her do some very ridiculous things, 
and forced themselves upon the public notice in many disagreeable
ways.&nbsp; Hence, the people soon came to dislike her, and she 
soon came to dislike them; and she did so much all through this 
reign in setting the King (who was dotingly fond of her) against 
his subjects, that it would have been better for him if she had 
never been born.</p>
<p>Now, you are to understand that King Charles the 
First&mdash;of his own determination to be a high and mighty King
not to be called to account by anybody, and urged on by his Queen
besides&mdash;deliberately set himself to put his Parliament down
and to put himself up. You are also to understand, that even in 
pursuit of this wrong idea (enough in itself to have ruined any 
king) he never took a straight course, but always took a crooked 
one.</p>
<p>He was bent upon war with Spain, though neither the House of 
Commons nor the people were quite clear as to the justice of that
war, now that they began to think a little more about the story 
of the Spanish match.&nbsp; But the King rushed into it hotly, 
raised money by illegal means to meet its expenses, and 
encountered a miserable failure at Cadiz, in the very first year 
of his reign.&nbsp; An expedition to Cadiz had been made in the 
hope of plunder, but as it was not successful, it was necessary 
to get a grant of money from the Parliament; and when they met, 
in no very complying humour, the King told them, &lsquo;to make 
haste to let him have it, or it would be the worse for 
themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not put in a more complying humour by 
this, they impeached the King&rsquo;s favourite, the Duke of 
Buckingham, as the cause (which he undoubtedly was) of many great
public grievances and wrongs.&nbsp; The King, to save him, 
dissolved the Parliament without getting the money he wanted; and
when the Lords implored him to consider and grant a little delay,
he replied, &lsquo;No, not one minute.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then began
to raise money for himself by the following means among 
others.</p>
<p>He levied certain duties called tonnage and poundage which had
not been granted by the Parliament, and could lawfully be levied 
by no other power; he called upon the seaport towns to furnish, 
and to pay all the cost for three months of, a fleet of armed 
ships; and he required the people to unite in lending him large 
sums of money, the repayment of which was very doubtful.&nbsp; If
the poor people refused, they were pressed as soldiers or 
sailors; if the gentry refused, they were sent to prison.&nbsp; 
Five gentlemen, named <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas 
Darnel</span>, <span class="smcap">John Corbet</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Walter Earl</span>, <span class="smcap">John 
Heveningham</span>, and <span class="smcap">Everard 
Hampden</span>, for refusing were taken up by a warrant of the 
King&rsquo;s privy council, and were sent to prison without any 
cause but the King&rsquo;s pleasure being stated for their 
imprisonment.&nbsp; Then the question came to be solemnly tried, 
whether this was not a violation of Magna Charta, and an 
encroachment by the King on the highest rights of the English 
people.&nbsp; His lawyers contended No, because to encroach upon 
the rights of the English people would be to do wrong, and the 
King could do no wrong.&nbsp; The accommodating judges decided in
favour of this wicked nonsense; and here was a fatal division 
between the King and the people.</p>
<p>For all this, it became necessary to call another 
Parliament.&nbsp; The people, sensible of the danger in which 
their liberties were, chose for it those who were best known for 
their determined opposition to the King; but still the King, 
quite blinded by his determination to carry everything before 
him, addressed them when they met, in a contemptuous manner, and 
just told them in so many words that he had only called them 
together because he wanted money.&nbsp; The Parliament, strong 
enough and resolute enough to know that they would lower his 
tone, cared little for what he said, and laid before him one of 
the great documents of history, which is called the <span 
class="smcap">Petition of Right</span>, requiring that the free 
men of England should no longer be called upon to lend the King 
money, and should no longer be pressed or imprisoned for refusing
to do so; further, that the free men of England should no longer 
be seized by the King&rsquo;s special mandate or warrant, it 
being contrary to their rights and liberties and the laws of 
their country.&nbsp; At first the King returned an answer to this
petition, in which he tried to shirk it altogether; but, the 
House of Commons then showing their determination to go on with 
the impeachment of Buckingham, the King in alarm returned an 
answer, giving his consent to all that was required of him.&nbsp;
He not only afterwards departed from his word and honour on these
points, over and over again, but, at this very time, he did the 
mean and dissembling act of publishing his first answer and not 
his second&mdash;merely that the people might suppose that the 
Parliament had not got the better of him.</p>
<p>That pestilent Buckingham, to gratify his own wounded vanity, 
had by this time involved the country in war with France, as well
as with Spain.&nbsp; For such miserable causes and such miserable
creatures are wars sometimes made!&nbsp; But he was destined to 
do little more mischief in this world.&nbsp; One morning, as he 
was going out of his house to his carriage, he turned to speak to
a certain Colonel <span class="smcap">Fryer</span> who was with 
him; and he was violently stabbed with a knife, which the 
murderer left sticking in his heart.&nbsp; This happened in his 
hall.&nbsp; He had had angry words up-stairs, just before, with 
some French gentlemen, who were immediately suspected by his 
servants, and had a close escape from being set upon and 
killed.&nbsp; In the midst of the noise, the real murderer, who 
had gone to the kitchen and might easily have got away, drew his 
sword and cried out, &lsquo;I am the man!&rsquo;&nbsp; His name 
was <span class="smcap">John Felton</span>, a Protestant and a 
retired officer in the army.&nbsp; He said he had had no personal
ill-will to the Duke, but had killed him as a curse to the 
country.&nbsp; He had aimed his blow well, for Buckingham had 
only had time to cry out, &lsquo;Villain!&rsquo; and then he drew
out the knife, fell against a table, and died.</p>
<p>The council made a mighty business of examining John Felton 
about this murder, though it was a plain case enough, one would 
think.&nbsp; He had come seventy miles to do it, he told them, 
and he did it for the reason he had declared; if they put him 
upon the rack, as that noble <span class="smcap">Marquis of 
Dorset</span> whom he saw before him, had the goodness to 
threaten, he gave that marquis warning, that he would accuse 
<i>him</i> as his accomplice!&nbsp; The King was unpleasantly 
anxious to have him racked, nevertheless; but as the judges now 
found out that torture was contrary to the law of 
England&mdash;it is a pity they did not make the discovery a 
little sooner&mdash;John Felton was simply executed for the 
murder he had done.&nbsp; A murder it undoubtedly was, and not in
the least to be defended: though he had freed England from one of
the most profligate, contemptible, and base court favourites to 
whom it has ever yielded.</p>
<p>A very different man now arose.&nbsp; This was <span 
class="smcap">Sir Thomas Wentworth</span>, a Yorkshire gentleman,
who had sat in Parliament for a long time, and who had favoured 
arbitrary and haughty principles, but who had gone over to the 
people&rsquo;s side on receiving offence from Buckingham.&nbsp; 
The King, much wanting such a man&mdash;for, besides being 
naturally favourable to the King&rsquo;s cause, he had great 
abilities&mdash;made him first a Baron, and then a Viscount, and 
gave him high employment, and won him most completely.</p>
<p>A Parliament, however, was still in existence, and was 
<i>not</i> to be won.&nbsp; On the twentieth of January, one 
thousand six hundred and twenty-nine, <span class="smcap">Sir 
John Eliot</span>, a great man who had been active in the 
Petition of Right, brought forward other strong resolutions 
against the King&rsquo;s chief instruments, and called upon the 
Speaker to put them to the vote.&nbsp; To this the Speaker 
answered, &lsquo;he was commanded otherwise by the King,&rsquo; 
and got up to leave the chair&mdash;which, according to the rules
of the House of Commons would have obliged it to adjourn without 
doing anything more&mdash;when two members, named Mr. <span 
class="smcap">Hollis</span> and Mr. <span 
class="smcap">Valentine</span>, held him down.&nbsp; A scene of 
great confusion arose among the members; and while many swords 
were drawn and flashing about, the King, who was kept informed of
all that was going on, told the captain of his guard to go down 
to the House and force the doors.&nbsp; The resolutions were by 
that time, however, voted, and the House adjourned.&nbsp; Sir 
John Eliot and those two members who had held the Speaker down, 
were quickly summoned before the council.&nbsp; As they claimed 
it to be their privilege not to answer out of Parliament for 
anything they had said in it, they were committed to the 
Tower.&nbsp; The King then went down and dissolved the 
Parliament, in a speech wherein he made mention of these 
gentlemen as &lsquo;Vipers&rsquo;&mdash;which did not do him much
good that ever I have heard of.</p>
<p>As they refused to gain their liberty by saying they were 
sorry for what they had done, the King, always remarkably 
unforgiving, never overlooked their offence.&nbsp; When they 
demanded to be brought up before the court of King&rsquo;s Bench,
he even resorted to the meanness of having them moved about from 
prison to prison, so that the writs issued for that purpose 
should not legally find them.&nbsp; At last they came before the 
court and were sentenced to heavy fines, and to be imprisoned 
during the King&rsquo;s pleasure.&nbsp; When Sir John 
Eliot&rsquo;s health had quite given way, and he so longed for 
change of air and scene as to petition for his release, the King 
sent back the answer (worthy of his Sowship himself) that the 
petition was not humble enough.&nbsp; When he sent another 
petition by his young son, in which he pathetically offered to go
back to prison when his health was restored, if he might be 
released for its recovery, the King still disregarded it.&nbsp; 
When he died in the Tower, and his children petitioned to be 
allowed to take his body down to Cornwall, there to lay it among 
the ashes of his forefathers, the King returned for answer, 
&lsquo;Let Sir John Eliot&rsquo;s body be buried in the church of
that parish where he died.&rsquo;&nbsp; All this was like a very 
little King indeed, I think.</p>
<p>And now, for twelve long years, steadily pursuing his design 
of setting himself up and putting the people down, the King 
called no Parliament; but ruled without one.&nbsp; If twelve 
thousand volumes were written in his praise (as a good many have 
been) it would still remain a fact, impossible to be denied, that
for twelve years King Charles the First reigned in England 
unlawfully and despotically, seized upon his subjects&rsquo; 
goods and money at his pleasure, and punished according to his 
unbridled will all who ventured to oppose him.&nbsp; It is a 
fashion with some people to think that this King&rsquo;s career 
was cut short; but I must say myself that I think he ran a pretty
long one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William Laud</span>, Archbishop of 
Canterbury, was the King&rsquo;s right-hand man in the religious 
part of the putting down of the people&rsquo;s liberties.&nbsp; 
Laud, who was a sincere man, of large learning but small 
sense&mdash;for the two things sometimes go together in very 
different quantities&mdash;though a Protestant, held opinions so 
near those of the Catholics, that the Pope wanted to make a 
Cardinal of him, if he would have accepted that favour.&nbsp; He 
looked upon vows, robes, lighted candles, images, and so forth, 
as amazingly important in religious ceremonies; and he brought in
an immensity of bowing and candle-snuffing.&nbsp; He also 
regarded archbishops and bishops as a sort of miraculous persons,
and was inveterate in the last degree against any who thought 
otherwise.&nbsp; Accordingly, he offered up thanks to Heaven, and
was in a state of much pious pleasure, when a Scotch clergyman, 
named <span class="smcap">Leighton</span>, was pilloried, 
whipped, branded in the cheek, and had one of his ears cut off 
and one of his nostrils slit, for calling bishops trumpery and 
the inventions of men.&nbsp; He originated on a Sunday morning 
the prosecution of <span class="smcap">William Prynne</span>, a 
barrister who was of similar opinions, and who was fined a 
thousand pounds; who was pilloried; who had his ears cut off on 
two occasions&mdash;one ear at a time&mdash;and who was 
imprisoned for life.&nbsp; He highly approved of the punishment 
of <span class="smcap">Doctor Bastwick</span>, a physician; who 
was also fined a thousand pounds; and who afterwards had 
<i>his</i> ears cut off, and was imprisoned for life.&nbsp; These
were gentle methods of persuasion, some will tell you: I think, 
they were rather calculated to be alarming to the people.</p>
<p>In the money part of the putting down of the people&rsquo;s 
liberties, the King was equally gentle, as some will tell you: as
I think, equally alarming.&nbsp; He levied those duties of 
tonnage and poundage, and increased them as he thought fit.&nbsp;
He granted monopolies to companies of merchants on their paying 
him for them, notwithstanding the great complaints that had, for 
years and years, been made on the subject of monopolies.&nbsp; He
fined the people for disobeying proclamations issued by his 
Sowship in direct violation of law.&nbsp; He revived the detested
Forest laws, and took private property to himself as his forest 
right.&nbsp; Above all, he determined to have what was called 
Ship Money; that is to say, money for the support of the 
fleet&mdash;not only from the seaports, but from all the counties
of England: having found out that, in some ancient time or other,
all the counties paid it.&nbsp; The grievance of this ship money 
being somewhat too strong, <span class="smcap">John 
Chambers</span>, a citizen of London, refused to pay his part of 
it.&nbsp; For this the Lord Mayor ordered John Chambers to 
prison, and for that John Chambers brought a suit against the 
Lord Mayor.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lord Say</span>, also, 
behaved like a real nobleman, and declared he would not 
pay.&nbsp; But, the sturdiest and best opponent of the ship money
was <span class="smcap">John Hampden</span>, a gentleman of 
Buckinghamshire, who had sat among the &lsquo;vipers&rsquo; in 
the House of Commons when there was such a thing, and who had 
been the bosom friend of Sir John Eliot.&nbsp; This case was 
tried before the twelve judges in the Court of Exchequer, and 
again the King&rsquo;s lawyers said it was impossible that ship 
money could be wrong, because the King could do no wrong, however
hard he tried&mdash;and he really did try very hard during these 
twelve years.&nbsp; Seven of the judges said that was quite true,
and Mr. Hampden was bound to pay: five of the judges said that 
was quite false, and Mr. Hampden was not bound to pay.&nbsp; So, 
the King triumphed (as he thought), by making Hampden the most 
popular man in England; where matters were getting to that height
now, that many honest Englishmen could not endure their country, 
and sailed away across the seas to found a colony in 
Massachusetts Bay in America.&nbsp; It is said that Hampden 
himself and his relation <span class="smcap">Oliver 
Cromwell</span> were going with a company of such voyagers, and 
were actually on board ship, when they were stopped by a 
proclamation, prohibiting sea captains to carry out such 
passengers without the royal license.&nbsp; But O! it would have 
been well for the King if he had let them go!&nbsp; This was the 
state of England.&nbsp; If Laud had been a madman just broke 
loose, he could not have done more mischief than he did in 
Scotland.&nbsp; In his endeavours (in which he was seconded by 
the King, then in person in that part of his dominions) to force 
his own ideas of bishops, and his own religious forms and 
ceremonies upon the Scotch, he roused that nation to a perfect 
frenzy.&nbsp; They formed a solemn league, which they called The 
Covenant, for the preservation of their own religious forms; they
rose in arms throughout the whole country; they summoned all 
their men to prayers and sermons twice a day by beat of drum; 
they sang psalms, in which they compared their enemies to all the
evil spirits that ever were heard of; and they solemnly vowed to 
smite them with the sword.&nbsp; At first the King tried force, 
then treaty, then a Scottish Parliament which did not answer at 
all.&nbsp; Then he tried the <span class="smcap">Earl of 
Strafford</span>, formerly Sir Thomas Wentworth; who, as <span 
class="smcap">Lord Wentworth</span>, had been governing 
Ireland.&nbsp; He, too, had carried it with a very high hand 
there, though to the benefit and prosperity of that country.</p>
<p>Strafford and Laud were for conquering the Scottish people by 
force of arms.&nbsp; Other lords who were taken into council, 
recommended that a Parliament should at last be called; to which 
the King unwillingly consented.&nbsp; So, on the thirteenth of 
April, one thousand six hundred and forty, that then strange 
sight, a Parliament, was seen at Westminster.&nbsp; It is called 
the Short Parliament, for it lasted a very little while.&nbsp; 
While the members were all looking at one another, doubtful who 
would dare to speak, <span class="smcap">Mr. Pym</span> arose and
set forth all that the King had done unlawfully during the past 
twelve years, and what was the position to which England was 
reduced.&nbsp; This great example set, other members took courage
and spoke the truth freely, though with great patience and 
moderation.&nbsp; The King, a little frightened, sent to say that
if they would grant him a certain sum on certain terms, no more 
ship money should be raised.&nbsp; They debated the matter for 
two days; and then, as they would not give him all he asked 
without promise or inquiry, he dissolved them.</p>
<p>But they knew very well that he must have a Parliament now; 
and he began to make that discovery too, though rather late in 
the day.&nbsp; Wherefore, on the twenty-fourth of September, 
being then at York with an army collected against the Scottish 
people, but his own men sullen and discontented like the rest of 
the nation, the King told the great council of the Lords, whom he
had called to meet him there, that he would summon another 
Parliament to assemble on the third of November.&nbsp; The 
soldiers of the Covenant had now forced their way into England 
and had taken possession of the northern counties, where the 
coals are got.&nbsp; As it would never do to be without coals, 
and as the King&rsquo;s troops could make no head against the 
Covenanters so full of gloomy zeal, a truce was made, and a 
treaty with Scotland was taken into consideration.&nbsp; 
Meanwhile the northern counties paid the Covenanters to leave the
coals alone, and keep quiet.</p>
<p>We have now disposed of the Short Parliament.&nbsp; We have 
next to see what memorable things were done by the Long one.</p>
<h3>SECOND PART</h3>
<p>The Long Parliament assembled on the third of November, one 
thousand six hundred and forty-one.&nbsp; That day week the Earl 
of Strafford arrived from York, very sensible that the spirited 
and determined men who formed that Parliament were no friends 
towards him, who had not only deserted the cause of the people, 
but who had on all occasions opposed himself to their 
liberties.&nbsp; The King told him, for his comfort, that the 
Parliament &lsquo;should not hurt one hair of his 
head.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, on the very next day Mr. Pym, in the 
House of Commons, and with great solemnity, impeached the Earl of
Strafford as a traitor.&nbsp; He was immediately taken into 
custody and fell from his proud height.</p>
<p>It was the twenty-second of March before he was brought to 
trial in Westminster Hall; where, although he was very ill and 
suffered great pain, he defended himself with such ability and 
majesty, that it was doubtful whether he would not get the best 
of it.&nbsp; But on the thirteenth day of the trial, Pym produced
in the House of Commons a copy of some notes of a council, found 
by young <span class="smcap">Sir Harry Vane</span> in a red 
velvet cabinet belonging to his father (Secretary Vane, who sat 
at the council-table with the Earl), in which Strafford had 
distinctly told the King that he was free from all rules and 
obligations of government, and might do with his people whatever 
he liked; and in which he had added&mdash;&lsquo;You have an army
in Ireland that you may employ to reduce this kingdom to 
obedience.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not clear whether by the words 
&lsquo;this kingdom,&rsquo; he had really meant England or 
Scotland; but the Parliament contended that he meant England, and
this was treason.&nbsp; At the same sitting of the House of 
Commons it was resolved to bring in a bill of attainder declaring
the treason to have been committed: in preference to proceeding 
with the trial by impeachment, which would have required the 
treason to be proved.</p>
<p>So, a bill was brought in at once, was carried through the 
House of Commons by a large majority, and was sent up to the 
House of Lords.&nbsp; While it was still uncertain whether the 
House of Lords would pass it and the King consent to it, Pym 
disclosed to the House of Commons that the King and Queen had 
both been plotting with the officers of the army to bring up the 
soldiers and control the Parliament, and also to introduce two 
hundred soldiers into the Tower of London to effect the 
Earl&rsquo;s escape.&nbsp; The plotting with the army was 
revealed by one <span class="smcap">George Goring</span>, the son
of a lord of that name: a bad fellow who was one of the original 
plotters, and turned traitor.&nbsp; The King had actually given 
his warrant for the admission of the two hundred men into the 
Tower, and they would have got in too, but for the refusal of the
governor&mdash;a sturdy Scotchman of the name of <span 
class="smcap">Balfour</span>&mdash;to admit them.&nbsp; These 
matters being made public, great numbers of people began to riot 
outside the Houses of Parliament, and to cry out for the 
execution of the Earl of Strafford, as one of the King&rsquo;s 
chief instruments against them.&nbsp; The bill passed the House 
of Lords while the people were in this state of agitation, and 
was laid before the King for his assent, together with another 
bill declaring that the Parliament then assembled should not be 
dissolved or adjourned without their own consent.&nbsp; The 
King&mdash;not unwilling to save a faithful servant, though he 
had no great attachment for him&mdash;was in some doubt what to 
do; but he gave his consent to both bills, although he in his 
heart believed that the bill against the Earl of Strafford was 
unlawful and unjust.&nbsp; The Earl had written to him, telling 
him that he was willing to die for his sake.&nbsp; But he had not
expected that his royal master would take him at his word quite 
so readily; for, when he heard his doom, he laid his hand upon 
his heart, and said, &lsquo;Put not your trust in 
Princes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King, who never could be straightforward and plain, 
through one single day or through one single sheet of paper, 
wrote a letter to the Lords, and sent it by the young Prince of 
Wales, entreating them to prevail with the Commons that 
&lsquo;that unfortunate man should fulfil the natural course of 
his life in a close imprisonment.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a postscript to
the very same letter, he added, &lsquo;If he must die, it were 
charity to reprieve him till Saturday.&rsquo;&nbsp; If there had 
been any doubt of his fate, this weakness and meanness would have
settled it.&nbsp; The very next day, which was the twelfth of 
May, he was brought out to be beheaded on Tower Hill.</p>
<p>Archbishop Laud, who had been so fond of having people&rsquo;s
ears cropped off and their noses slit, was now confined in the 
Tower too; and when the Earl went by his window to his death, he 
was there, at his request, to give him his blessing.&nbsp; They 
had been great friends in the King&rsquo;s cause, and the Earl 
had written to him in the days of their power that he thought it 
would be an admirable thing to have Mr. Hampden publicly whipped 
for refusing to pay the ship money.&nbsp; However, those high and
mighty doings were over now, and the Earl went his way to death 
with dignity and heroism.&nbsp; The governor wished him to get 
into a coach at the Tower gate, for fear the people should tear 
him to pieces; but he said it was all one to him whether he died 
by the axe or by the people&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; So, he walked, 
with a firm tread and a stately look, and sometimes pulled off 
his hat to them as he passed along.&nbsp; They were profoundly 
quiet.&nbsp; He made a speech on the scaffold from some notes he 
had prepared (the paper was found lying there after his head was 
struck off), and one blow of the axe killed him, in the 
forty-ninth year of his age.</p>
<p>This bold and daring act, the Parliament accompanied by other 
famous measures, all originating (as even this did) in the 
King&rsquo;s having so grossly and so long abused his 
power.&nbsp; The name of <span class="smcap">Delinquents</span> 
was applied to all sheriffs and other officers who had been 
concerned in raising the ship money, or any other money, from the
people, in an unlawful manner; the Hampden judgment was reversed;
the judges who had decided against Hampden were called upon to 
give large securities that they would take such consequences as 
Parliament might impose upon them; and one was arrested as he sat
in High Court, and carried off to prison.&nbsp; Laud was 
impeached; the unfortunate victims whose ears had been cropped 
and whose noses had been slit, were brought out of prison in 
triumph; and a bill was passed declaring that a Parliament should
be called every third year, and that if the King and the 
King&rsquo;s officers did not call it, the people should assemble
of themselves and summon it, as of their own right and 
power.&nbsp; Great illuminations and rejoicings took place over 
all these things, and the country was wildly excited.&nbsp; That 
the Parliament took advantage of this excitement and stirred them
up by every means, there is no doubt; but you are always to 
remember those twelve long years, during which the King had tried
so hard whether he really could do any wrong or not.</p>
<p>All this time there was a great religious outcry against the 
right of the Bishops to sit in Parliament; to which the Scottish 
people particularly objected.&nbsp; The English were divided on 
this subject, and, partly on this account and partly because they
had had foolish expectations that the Parliament would be able to
take off nearly all the taxes, numbers of them sometimes wavered 
and inclined towards the King.</p>
<p>I believe myself, that if, at this or almost any other period 
of his life, the King could have been trusted by any man not out 
of his senses, he might have saved himself and kept his 
throne.&nbsp; But, on the English army being disbanded, he 
plotted with the officers again, as he had done before, and 
established the fact beyond all doubt by putting his signature of
approval to a petition against the Parliamentary leaders, which 
was drawn up by certain officers.&nbsp; When the Scottish army 
was disbanded, he went to Edinburgh in four days&mdash;which was 
going very fast at that time&mdash;to plot again, and so darkly 
too, that it is difficult to decide what his whole object 
was.&nbsp; Some suppose that he wanted to gain over the Scottish 
Parliament, as he did in fact gain over, by presents and favours,
many Scottish lords and men of power.&nbsp; Some think that he 
went to get proofs against the Parliamentary leaders in England 
of their having treasonably invited the Scottish people to come 
and help them.&nbsp; With whatever object he went to Scotland, he
did little good by going.&nbsp; At the instigation of the <span 
class="smcap">Earl of Montrose</span>, a desperate man who was 
then in prison for plotting, he tried to kidnap three Scottish 
lords who escaped.&nbsp; A committee of the Parliament at home, 
who had followed to watch him, writing an account of this <span 
class="smcap">Incident</span>, as it was called, to the 
Parliament, the Parliament made a fresh stir about it; were, or 
feigned to be, much alarmed for themselves; and wrote to the 
<span class="smcap">Earl of Essex</span>, the commander-in-chief,
for a guard to protect them.</p>
<p>It is not absolutely proved that the King plotted in Ireland 
besides, but it is very probable that he did, and that the Queen 
did, and that he had some wild hope of gaining the Irish people 
over to his side by favouring a rise among them.&nbsp; Whether or
no, they did rise in a most brutal and savage rebellion; in 
which, encouraged by their priests, they committed such 
atrocities upon numbers of the English, of both sexes and of all 
ages, as nobody could believe, but for their being related on 
oath by eye-witnesses.&nbsp; Whether one hundred thousand or two 
hundred thousand Protestants were murdered in this outbreak, is 
uncertain; but, that it was as ruthless and barbarous an outbreak
as ever was known among any savage people, is certain.</p>
<p>The King came home from Scotland, determined to make a great 
struggle for his lost power.&nbsp; He believed that, through his 
presents and favours, Scotland would take no part against him; 
and the Lord Mayor of London received him with such a magnificent
dinner that he thought he must have become popular again in 
England.&nbsp; It would take a good many Lord Mayors, however, to
make a people, and the King soon found himself mistaken.</p>
<p>Not so soon, though, but that there was a great opposition in 
the Parliament to a celebrated paper put forth by Pym and Hampden
and the rest, called &lsquo;<span class="smcap">The 
Remonstrance</span>,&rsquo; which set forth all the illegal acts 
that the King had ever done, but politely laid the blame of them 
on his bad advisers.&nbsp; Even when it was passed and presented 
to him, the King still thought himself strong enough to discharge
Balfour from his command in the Tower, and to put in his place a 
man of bad character; to whom the Commons instantly objected, and
whom he was obliged to abandon.&nbsp; At this time, the old 
outcry about the Bishops became louder than ever, and the old 
Archbishop of York was so near being murdered as he went down to 
the House of Lords&mdash;being laid hold of by the mob and 
violently knocked about, in return for very foolishly scolding a 
shrill boy who was yelping out &lsquo;No 
Bishops!&rsquo;&mdash;that he sent for all the Bishops who were 
in town, and proposed to them to sign a declaration that, as they
could no longer without danger to their lives attend their duty 
in Parliament, they protested against the lawfulness of 
everything done in their absence.&nbsp; This they asked the King 
to send to the House of Lords, which he did.&nbsp; Then the House
of Commons impeached the whole party of Bishops and sent them off
to the Tower:</p>
<p>Taking no warning from this; but encouraged by there being a 
moderate party in the Parliament who objected to these strong 
measures, the King, on the third of January, one thousand six 
hundred and forty-two, took the rashest step that ever was taken 
by mortal man.</p>
<p>Of his own accord and without advice, he sent the 
Attorney-General to the House of Lords, to accuse of treason 
certain members of Parliament who as popular leaders were the 
most obnoxious to him; <span class="smcap">Lord Kimbolton</span>,
<span class="smcap">Sir Arthur Haselrig</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Denzil Hollis</span>, <span class="smcap">John 
Pym</span> (they used to call him King Pym, he possessed such 
power and looked so big), <span class="smcap">John 
Hampden</span>, and <span class="smcap">William 
Strode</span>.&nbsp; The houses of those members he caused to be 
entered, and their papers to be sealed up.&nbsp; At the same 
time, he sent a messenger to the House of Commons demanding to 
have the five gentlemen who were members of that House 
immediately produced.&nbsp; To this the House replied that they 
should appear as soon as there was any legal charge against them,
and immediately adjourned.</p>
<p>Next day, the House of Commons send into the City to let the 
Lord Mayor know that their privileges are invaded by the King, 
and that there is no safety for anybody or anything.&nbsp; Then, 
when the five members are gone out of the way, down comes the 
King himself, with all his guard and from two to three hundred 
gentlemen and soldiers, of whom the greater part were 
armed.&nbsp; These he leaves in the hall; and then, with his 
nephew at his side, goes into the House, takes off his hat, and 
walks up to the Speaker&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; The Speaker leaves 
it, the King stands in front of it, looks about him steadily for 
a little while, and says he has come for those five 
members.&nbsp; No one speaks, and then he calls John Pym by 
name.&nbsp; No one speaks, and then he calls Denzil Hollis by 
name.&nbsp; No one speaks, and then he asks the Speaker of the 
House where those five members are?&nbsp; The Speaker, answering 
on his knee, nobly replies that he is the servant of that House, 
and that he has neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak, 
anything but what the House commands him.&nbsp; Upon this, the 
King, beaten from that time evermore, replies that he will seek 
them himself, for they have committed treason; and goes out, with
his hat in his hand, amid some audible murmurs from the 
members.</p>
<p>No words can describe the hurry that arose out of doors when 
all this was known.&nbsp; The five members had gone for safety to
a house in Coleman-street, in the City, where they were guarded 
all night; and indeed the whole city watched in arms like an 
army.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the King, 
already frightened at what he had done, came to the Guildhall, 
with only half a dozen lords, and made a speech to the people, 
hoping they would not shelter those whom he accused of 
treason.&nbsp; Next day, he issued a proclamation for the 
apprehension of the five members; but the Parliament minded it so
little that they made great arrangements for having them brought 
down to Westminster in great state, five days afterwards.&nbsp; 
The King was so alarmed now at his own imprudence, if not for his
own safety, that he left his palace at Whitehall, and went away 
with his Queen and children to Hampton Court.</p>
<p>It was the eleventh of May, when the five members were carried
in state and triumph to Westminster.&nbsp; They were taken by 
water.&nbsp; The river could not be seen for the boats on it; and
the five members were hemmed in by barges full of men and great 
guns, ready to protect them, at any cost.&nbsp; Along the Strand 
a large body of the train-bands of London, under their commander,
<span class="smcap">Skippon</span>, marched to be ready to assist
the little fleet.&nbsp; Beyond them, came a crowd who choked the 
streets, roaring incessantly about the Bishops and the Papists, 
and crying out contemptuously as they passed Whitehall, 
&lsquo;What has become of the King?&rsquo;&nbsp; With this great 
noise outside the House of Commons, and with great silence 
within, Mr. Pym rose and informed the House of the great kindness
with which they had been received in the City.&nbsp; Upon that, 
the House called the sheriffs in and thanked them, and requested 
the train-bands, under their commander Skippon, to guard the 
House of Commons every day.&nbsp; Then, came four thousand men on
horseback out of Buckinghamshire, offering their services as a 
guard too, and bearing a petition to the King, complaining of the
injury that had been done to Mr. Hampden, who was their county 
man and much beloved and honoured.</p>
<p>When the King set off for Hampton Court, the gentlemen and 
soldiers who had been with him followed him out of town as far as
Kingston-upon-Thames; next day, Lord Digby came to them from the 
King at Hampton Court, in his coach and six, to inform them that 
the King accepted their protection.&nbsp; This, the Parliament 
said, was making war against the kingdom, and Lord Digby fled 
abroad.&nbsp; The Parliament then immediately applied themselves 
to getting hold of the military power of the country, well 
knowing that the King was already trying hard to use it against 
them, and that he had secretly sent the Earl of Newcastle to 
Hull, to secure a valuable magazine of arms and gunpowder that 
was there.&nbsp; In those times, every county had its own 
magazines of arms and powder, for its own train-bands or militia;
so, the Parliament brought in a bill claiming the right (which up
to this time had belonged to the King) of appointing the Lord 
Lieutenants of counties, who commanded these train-bands; also, 
of having all the forts, castles, and garrisons in the kingdom, 
put into the hands of such governors as they, the Parliament, 
could confide in.&nbsp; It also passed a law depriving the 
Bishops of their votes.&nbsp; The King gave his assent to that 
bill, but would not abandon the right of appointing the Lord 
Lieutenants, though he said he was willing to appoint such as 
might be suggested to him by the Parliament.&nbsp; When the Earl 
of Pembroke asked him whether he would not give way on that 
question for a time, he said, &lsquo;By God! not for one 
hour!&rsquo; and upon this he and the Parliament went to war.</p>
<p>His young daughter was betrothed to the Prince of 
Orange.&nbsp; On pretence of taking her to the country of her 
future husband, the Queen was already got safely away to Holland,
there to pawn the Crown jewels for money to raise an army on the 
King&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; The Lord Admiral being sick, the House 
of Commons now named the Earl of Warwick to hold his place for a 
year.&nbsp; The King named another gentleman; the House of 
Commons took its own way, and the Earl of Warwick became Lord 
Admiral without the King&rsquo;s consent.&nbsp; The Parliament 
sent orders down to Hull to have that magazine removed to London;
the King went down to Hull to take it himself.&nbsp; The citizens
would not admit him into the town, and the governor would not 
admit him into the castle.&nbsp; The Parliament resolved that 
whatever the two Houses passed, and the King would not consent 
to, should be called an <span class="smcap">Ordinance</span>, and
should be as much a law as if he did consent to it.&nbsp; The 
King protested against this, and gave notice that these 
ordinances were not to be obeyed.&nbsp; The King, attended by the
majority of the House of Peers, and by many members of the House 
of Commons, established himself at York.&nbsp; The Chancellor 
went to him with the Great Seal, and the Parliament made a new 
Great Seal.&nbsp; The Queen sent over a ship full of arms and 
ammunition, and the King issued letters to borrow money at high 
interest.&nbsp; The Parliament raised twenty regiments of foot 
and seventy-five troops of horse; and the people willingly aided 
them with their money, plate, jewellery, and trinkets&mdash;the 
married women even with their wedding-rings.&nbsp; Every member 
of Parliament who could raise a troop or a regiment in his own 
part of the country, dressed it according to his taste and in his
own colours, and commanded it.&nbsp; Foremost among them all, 
<span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span> raised a troop of 
horse&mdash;thoroughly in earnest and thoroughly well 
armed&mdash;who were, perhaps, the best soldiers that ever were 
seen.</p>
<p>In some of their proceedings, this famous Parliament passed 
the bounds of previous law and custom, yielded to and favoured 
riotous assemblages of the people, and acted tyrannically in 
imprisoning some who differed from the popular leaders.&nbsp; But
again, you are always to remember that the twelve years during 
which the King had had his own wilful way, had gone before; and 
that nothing could make the times what they might, could, would, 
or should have been, if those twelve years had never rolled 
away.</p>
<h3>THIRD PART</h3>
<p>I shall not try to relate the particulars of the great civil 
war between King Charles the First and the Long Parliament, which
lasted nearly four years, and a full account of which would fill 
many large books.&nbsp; It was a sad thing that Englishmen should
once more be fighting against Englishmen on English ground; but, 
it is some consolation to know that on both sides there was great
humanity, forbearance, and honour.&nbsp; The soldiers of the 
Parliament were far more remarkable for these good qualities than
the soldiers of the King (many of whom fought for mere pay 
without much caring for the cause); but those of the nobility and
gentry who were on the King&rsquo;s side were so brave, and so 
faithful to him, that their conduct cannot but command our 
highest admiration.&nbsp; Among them were great numbers of 
Catholics, who took the royal side because the Queen was so 
strongly of their persuasion.</p>
<p>The King might have distinguished some of these gallant 
spirits, if he had been as generous a spirit himself, by giving 
them the command of his army.&nbsp; Instead of that, however, 
true to his old high notions of royalty, he entrusted it to his 
two nephews, <span class="smcap">Prince Rupert</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Prince Maurice</span>, who were of royal blood and 
came over from abroad to help him.&nbsp; It might have been 
better for him if they had stayed away; since Prince Rupert was 
an impetuous, hot-headed fellow, whose only idea was to dash into
battle at all times and seasons, and lay about him.</p>
<p>The general-in-chief of the Parliamentary army was the Earl of
Essex, a gentleman of honour and an excellent soldier.&nbsp; A 
little while before the war broke out, there had been some 
rioting at Westminster between certain officious law students and
noisy soldiers, and the shopkeepers and their apprentices, and 
the general people in the streets.&nbsp; At that time the 
King&rsquo;s friends called the crowd, Roundheads, because the 
apprentices wore short hair; the crowd, in return, called their 
opponents Cavaliers, meaning that they were a blustering set, who
pretended to be very military.&nbsp; These two words now began to
be used to distinguish the two sides in the civil war.&nbsp; The 
Royalists also called the Parliamentary men Rebels and Rogues, 
while the Parliamentary men called <i>them</i> Malignants, and 
spoke of themselves as the Godly, the Honest, and so forth.</p>
<p>The war broke out at Portsmouth, where that double traitor 
Goring had again gone over to the King and was besieged by the 
Parliamentary troops.&nbsp; Upon this, the King proclaimed the 
Earl of Essex and the officers serving under him, traitors, and 
called upon his loyal subjects to meet him in arms at Nottingham 
on the twenty-fifth of August.&nbsp; But his loyal subjects came 
about him in scanty numbers, and it was a windy, gloomy day, and 
the Royal Standard got blown down, and the whole affair was very 
melancholy.&nbsp; The chief engagements after this, took place in
the vale of the Red Horse near Banbury, at Brentford, at Devizes,
at Chalgrave Field (where Mr. Hampden was so sorely wounded while
fighting at the head of his men, that he died within a week), at 
Newbury (in which battle <span class="smcap">Lord 
Falkland</span>, one of the best noblemen on the King&rsquo;s 
side, was killed), at Leicester, at Naseby, at Winchester, at 
Marston Moor near York, at Newcastle, and in many other parts of 
England and Scotland.&nbsp; These battles were attended with 
various successes.&nbsp; At one time, the King was victorious; at
another time, the Parliament.&nbsp; But almost all the great and 
busy towns were against the King; and when it was considered 
necessary to fortify London, all ranks of people, from labouring 
men and women, up to lords and ladies, worked hard together with 
heartiness and good will.&nbsp; The most distinguished leaders on
the Parliamentary side were <span class="smcap">Hampden</span>, 
<span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Fairfax</span>, and, above all, 
<span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>, and his son-in-law 
<span class="smcap">Ireton</span>.</p>
<p>During the whole of this war, the people, to whom it was very 
expensive and irksome, and to whom it was made the more 
distressing by almost every family being divided&mdash;some of 
its members attaching themselves to one side and some to the 
other&mdash;were over and over again most anxious for 
peace.&nbsp; So were some of the best men in each cause.&nbsp; 
Accordingly, treaties of peace were discussed between 
commissioners from the Parliament and the King; at York, at 
Oxford (where the King held a little Parliament of his own), and 
at Uxbridge.&nbsp; But they came to nothing.&nbsp; In all these 
negotiations, and in all his difficulties, the King showed 
himself at his best.&nbsp; He was courageous, cool, 
self-possessed, and clever; but, the old taint of his character 
was always in him, and he was never for one single moment to be 
trusted.&nbsp; Lord Clarendon, the historian, one of his highest 
admirers, supposes that he had unhappily promised the Queen never
to make peace without her consent, and that this must often be 
taken as his excuse.&nbsp; He never kept his word from night to 
morning.&nbsp; He signed a cessation of hostilities with the 
blood-stained Irish rebels for a sum of money, and invited the 
Irish regiments over, to help him against the Parliament.&nbsp; 
In the battle of Naseby, his cabinet was seized and was found to 
contain a correspondence with the Queen, in which he expressly 
told her that he had deceived the Parliament&mdash;a mongrel 
Parliament, he called it now, as an improvement on his old term 
of vipers&mdash;in pretending to recognise it and to treat with 
it; and from which it further appeared that he had long been in 
secret treaty with the Duke of Lorraine for a foreign army of ten
thousand men.&nbsp; Disappointed in this, he sent a most devoted 
friend of his, the <span class="smcap">Earl of Glamorgan</span>, 
to Ireland, to conclude a secret treaty with the Catholic powers,
to send him an Irish army of ten thousand men; in return for 
which he was to bestow great favours on the Catholic 
religion.&nbsp; And, when this treaty was discovered in the 
carriage of a fighting Irish Archbishop who was killed in one of 
the many skirmishes of those days, he basely denied and deserted 
his attached friend, the Earl, on his being charged with high 
treason; and&mdash;even worse than this&mdash;had left blanks in 
the secret instructions he gave him with his own kingly hand, 
expressly that he might thus save himself.</p>
<p>At last, on the twenty-seventh day of April, one thousand six 
hundred and forty-six, the King found himself in the city of 
Oxford, so surrounded by the Parliamentary army who were closing 
in upon him on all sides that he felt that if he would escape he 
must delay no longer.&nbsp; So, that night, having altered the 
cut of his hair and beard, he was dressed up as a servant and put
upon a horse with a cloak strapped behind him, and rode out of 
the town behind one of his own faithful followers, with a 
clergyman of that country who knew the road well, for a 
guide.&nbsp; He rode towards London as far as Harrow, and then 
altered his plans and resolved, it would seem, to go to the 
Scottish camp.&nbsp; The Scottish men had been invited over to 
help the Parliamentary army, and had a large force then in 
England.&nbsp; The King was so desperately intriguing in 
everything he did, that it is doubtful what he exactly meant by 
this step.&nbsp; He took it, anyhow, and delivered himself up to 
the <span class="smcap">Earl of Leven</span>, the Scottish 
general-in-chief, who treated him as an honourable 
prisoner.&nbsp; Negotiations between the Parliament on the one 
hand and the Scottish authorities on the other, as to what should
be done with him, lasted until the following February.&nbsp; 
Then, when the King had refused to the Parliament the concession 
of that old militia point for twenty years, and had refused to 
Scotland the recognition of its Solemn League and Covenant, 
Scotland got a handsome sum for its army and its help, and the 
King into the bargain.&nbsp; He was taken, by certain 
Parliamentary commissioners appointed to receive him, to one of 
his own houses, called Holmby House, near Althorpe, in 
Northamptonshire.</p>
<p>While the Civil War was still in progress, John Pym died, and 
was buried with great honour in Westminster Abbey&mdash;not with 
greater honour than he deserved, for the liberties of Englishmen 
owe a mighty debt to Pym and Hampden.&nbsp; The war was but newly
over when the Earl of Essex died, of an illness brought on by his
having overheated himself in a stag hunt in Windsor Forest.&nbsp;
He, too, was buried in Westminster Abbey, with great state.&nbsp;
I wish it were not necessary to add that Archbishop Laud died 
upon the scaffold when the war was not yet done.&nbsp; His trial 
lasted in all nearly a year, and, it being doubtful even then 
whether the charges brought against him amounted to treason, the 
odious old contrivance of the worst kings was resorted to, and a 
bill of attainder was brought in against him.&nbsp; He was a 
violently prejudiced and mischievous person; had had strong 
ear-cropping and nose-splitting propensities, as you know; and 
had done a world of harm.&nbsp; But he died peaceably, and like a
brave old man.</p>
<h3>FOURTH PART</h3>
<p>When the Parliament had got the King into their hands, they 
became very anxious to get rid of their army, in which Oliver 
Cromwell had begun to acquire great power; not only because of 
his courage and high abilities, but because he professed to be 
very sincere in the Scottish sort of Puritan religion that was 
then exceedingly popular among the soldiers.&nbsp; They were as 
much opposed to the Bishops as to the Pope himself; and the very 
privates, drummers, and trumpeters, had such an inconvenient 
habit of starting up and preaching long-winded discourses, that I
would not have belonged to that army on any account.</p>
<p>So, the Parliament, being far from sure but that the army 
might begin to preach and fight against them now it had nothing 
else to do, proposed to disband the greater part of it, to send 
another part to serve in Ireland against the rebels, and to keep 
only a small force in England.&nbsp; But, the army would not 
consent to be broken up, except upon its own conditions; and, 
when the Parliament showed an intention of compelling it, it 
acted for itself in an unexpected manner.&nbsp; A certain cornet,
of the name of <span class="smcap">Joice</span>, arrived at 
Holmby House one night, attended by four hundred horsemen, went 
into the King&rsquo;s room with his hat in one hand and a pistol 
in the other, and told the King that he had come to take him 
away.&nbsp; The King was willing enough to go, and only 
stipulated that he should be publicly required to do so next 
morning.&nbsp; Next morning, accordingly, he appeared on the top 
of the steps of the house, and asked Comet Joice before his men 
and the guard set there by the Parliament, what authority he had 
for taking him away?&nbsp; To this Cornet Joice replied, 
&lsquo;The authority of the army.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you a 
written commission?&rsquo; said the King.&nbsp; Joice, pointing 
to his four hundred men on horseback, replied, &lsquo;That is my 
commission.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the King, 
smiling, as if he were pleased, &lsquo;I never before read such a
commission; but it is written in fair and legible 
characters.&nbsp; This is a company of as handsome proper 
gentlemen as I have seen a long while.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was asked 
where he would like to live, and he said at Newmarket.&nbsp; So, 
to Newmarket he and Cornet Joice and the four hundred horsemen 
rode; the King remarking, in the same smiling way, that he could 
ride as far at a spell as Cornet Joice, or any man there.</p>
<p>The King quite believed, I think, that the army were his 
friends.&nbsp; He said as much to Fairfax when that general, 
Oliver Cromwell, and Ireton, went to persuade him to return to 
the custody of the Parliament.&nbsp; He preferred to remain as he
was, and resolved to remain as he was.&nbsp; And when the army 
moved nearer and nearer London to frighten the Parliament into 
yielding to their demands, they took the King with them.&nbsp; It
was a deplorable thing that England should be at the mercy of a 
great body of soldiers with arms in their hands; but the King 
certainly favoured them at this important time of his life, as 
compared with the more lawful power that tried to control 
him.&nbsp; It must be added, however, that they treated him, as 
yet, more respectfully and kindly than the Parliament had 
done.&nbsp; They allowed him to be attended by his own servants, 
to be splendidly entertained at various houses, and to see his 
children&mdash;at Cavesham House, near Reading&mdash;for two 
days.&nbsp; Whereas, the Parliament had been rather hard with 
him, and had only allowed him to ride out and play at bowls.</p>
<p>It is much to be believed that if the King could have been 
trusted, even at this time, he might have been saved.&nbsp; Even 
Oliver Cromwell expressly said that he did believe that no man 
could enjoy his possessions in peace, unless the King had his 
rights.&nbsp; He was not unfriendly towards the King; he had been
present when he received his children, and had been much affected
by the pitiable nature of the scene; he saw the King often; he 
frequently walked and talked with him in the long galleries and 
pleasant gardens of the Palace at Hampton Court, whither he was 
now removed; and in all this risked something of his influence 
with the army.&nbsp; But, the King was in secret hopes of help 
from the Scottish people; and the moment he was encouraged to 
join them he began to be cool to his new friends, the army, and 
to tell the officers that they could not possibly do without 
him.&nbsp; At the very time, too, when he was promising to make 
Cromwell and Ireton noblemen, if they would help him up to his 
old height, he was writing to the Queen that he meant to hang 
them.&nbsp; They both afterwards declared that they had been 
privately informed that such a letter would be found, on a 
certain evening, sewed up in a saddle which would be taken to the
Blue Boar in Holborn to be sent to Dover; and that they went 
there, disguised as common soldiers, and sat drinking in the 
inn-yard until a man came with the saddle, which they ripped up 
with their knives, and therein found the letter.&nbsp; I see 
little reason to doubt the story.&nbsp; It is certain that Oliver
Cromwell told one of the King&rsquo;s most faithful followers 
that the King could not be trusted, and that he would not be 
answerable if anything amiss were to happen to him.&nbsp; Still, 
even after that, he kept a promise he had made to the King, by 
letting him know that there was a plot with a certain portion of 
the army to seize him.&nbsp; I believe that, in fact, he 
sincerely wanted the King to escape abroad, and so to be got rid 
of without more trouble or danger.&nbsp; That Oliver himself had 
work enough with the army is pretty plain; for some of the troops
were so mutinous against him, and against those who acted with 
him at this time, that he found it necessary to have one man shot
at the head of his regiment to overawe the rest.</p>
<p>The King, when he received Oliver&rsquo;s warning, made his 
escape from Hampton Court; after some indecision and uncertainty,
he went to Carisbrooke Castle in the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; At 
first, he was pretty free there; but, even there, he carried on a
pretended treaty with the Parliament, while he was really 
treating with commissioners from Scotland to send an army into 
England to take his part.&nbsp; When he broke off this treaty 
with the Parliament (having settled with Scotland) and was 
treated as a prisoner, his treatment was not changed too soon, 
for he had plotted to escape that very night to a ship sent by 
the Queen, which was lying off the island.</p>
<p>He was doomed to be disappointed in his hopes from 
Scotland.&nbsp; The agreement he had made with the Scottish 
Commissioners was not favourable enough to the religion of that 
country to please the Scottish clergy; and they preached against 
it.&nbsp; The consequence was, that the army raised in Scotland 
and sent over, was too small to do much; and that, although it 
was helped by a rising of the Royalists in England and by good 
soldiers from Ireland, it could make no head against the 
Parliamentary army under such men as Cromwell and Fairfax.&nbsp; 
The King&rsquo;s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, came over from 
Holland with nineteen ships (a part of the English fleet having 
gone over to him) to help his father; but nothing came of his 
voyage, and he was fain to return.&nbsp; The most remarkable 
event of this second civil war was the cruel execution by the 
Parliamentary General, of <span class="smcap">Sir Charles 
Lucas</span> and <span class="smcap">Sir George Lisle</span>, two
grand Royalist generals, who had bravely defended Colchester 
under every disadvantage of famine and distress for nearly three 
months.&nbsp; When Sir Charles Lucas was shot, Sir George Lisle 
kissed his body, and said to the soldiers who were to shoot him, 
&lsquo;Come nearer, and make sure of me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
warrant you, Sir George,&rsquo; said one of the soldiers, 
&lsquo;we shall hit you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<span 
class="smcap">Ay</span>?&rsquo; he returned with a smile, 
&lsquo;but I have been nearer to you, my friends, many a time, 
and you have missed me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Parliament, after being fearfully bullied by the 
army&mdash;who demanded to have seven members whom they disliked 
given up to them&mdash;had voted that they would have nothing 
more to do with the King.&nbsp; On the conclusion, however, of 
this second civil war (which did not last more than six months), 
they appointed commissioners to treat with him.&nbsp; The King, 
then so far released again as to be allowed to live in a private 
house at Newport in the Isle of Wight, managed his own part of 
the negotiation with a sense that was admired by all who saw him,
and gave up, in the end, all that was asked of him&mdash;even 
yielding (which he had steadily refused, so far) to the temporary
abolition of the bishops, and the transfer of their church land 
to the Crown.&nbsp; Still, with his old fatal vice upon him, when
his best friends joined the commissioners in beseeching him to 
yield all those points as the only means of saving himself from 
the army, he was plotting to escape from the island; he was 
holding correspondence with his friends and the Catholics in 
Ireland, though declaring that he was not; and he was writing, 
with his own hand, that in what he yielded he meant nothing but 
to get time to escape.</p>
<p>Matters were at this pass when the army, resolved to defy the 
Parliament, marched up to London.&nbsp; The Parliament, not 
afraid of them now, and boldly led by Hollis, voted that the 
King&rsquo;s concessions were sufficient ground for settling the 
peace of the kingdom.&nbsp; Upon that, <span 
class="smcap">Colonel Rich</span> and <span class="smcap">Colonel
Pride</span> went down to the House of Commons with a regiment of
horse soldiers and a regiment of foot; and Colonel Pride, 
standing in the lobby with a list of the members who were 
obnoxious to the army in his hand, had them pointed out to him as
they came through, and took them all into custody.&nbsp; This 
proceeding was afterwards called by the people, for a joke, <span
class="smcap">Pride&rsquo;s Purge</span>.&nbsp; Cromwell was in 
the North, at the head of his men, at the time, but when he came 
home, approved of what had been done.</p>
<p>What with imprisoning some members and causing others to stay 
away, the army had now reduced the House of Commons to some fifty
or so.&nbsp; These soon voted that it was treason in a king to 
make war against his parliament and his people, and sent an 
ordinance up to the House of Lords for the King&rsquo;s being 
tried as a traitor.&nbsp; The House of Lords, then sixteen in 
number, to a man rejected it.&nbsp; Thereupon, the Commons made 
an ordinance of their own, that they were the supreme government 
of the country, and would bring the King to trial.</p>
<p>The King had been taken for security to a place called Hurst 
Castle: a lonely house on a rock in the sea, connected with the 
coast of Hampshire by a rough road two miles long at low 
water.&nbsp; Thence, he was ordered to be removed to Windsor; 
thence, after being but rudely used there, and having none but 
soldiers to wait upon him at table, he was brought up to St. 
James&rsquo;s Palace in London, and told that his trial was 
appointed for next day.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the twentieth of January, one thousand six 
hundred and forty-nine, this memorable trial began.&nbsp; The 
House of Commons had settled that one hundred and thirty-five 
persons should form the Court, and these were taken from the 
House itself, from among the officers of the army, and from among
the lawyers and citizens.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John 
Bradshaw</span>, serjeant-at-law, was appointed president.&nbsp; 
The place was Westminster Hall.&nbsp; At the upper end, in a red 
velvet chair, sat the president, with his hat (lined with plates 
of iron for his protection) on his head.&nbsp; The rest of the 
Court sat on side benches, also wearing their hats.&nbsp; The 
King&rsquo;s seat was covered with velvet, like that of the 
president, and was opposite to it.&nbsp; He was brought from St. 
James&rsquo;s to Whitehall, and from Whitehall he came by water 
to his trial.</p>
<p>When he came in, he looked round very steadily on the Court, 
and on the great number of spectators, and then sat down: 
presently he got up and looked round again.&nbsp; On the 
indictment &lsquo;against Charles Stuart, for high 
treason,&rsquo; being read, he smiled several times, and he 
denied the authority of the Court, saying that there could be no 
parliament without a House of Lords, and that he saw no House of 
Lords there.&nbsp; Also, that the King ought to be there, and 
that he saw no King in the King&rsquo;s right place.&nbsp; 
Bradshaw replied, that the Court was satisfied with its 
authority, and that its authority was God&rsquo;s authority and 
the kingdom&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He then adjourned the Court to the 
following Monday.&nbsp; On that day, the trial was resumed, and 
went on all the week.&nbsp; When the Saturday came, as the King 
passed forward to his place in the Hall, some soldiers and others
cried for &lsquo;justice!&rsquo; and execution on him.&nbsp; That
day, too, Bradshaw, like an angry Sultan, wore a red robe, 
instead of the black robe he had worn before.&nbsp; The King was 
sentenced to death that day.&nbsp; As he went out, one solitary 
soldier said, &lsquo;God bless you, Sir!&rsquo;&nbsp; For this, 
his officer struck him.&nbsp; The King said he thought the 
punishment exceeded the offence.&nbsp; The silver head of his 
walking-stick had fallen off while he leaned upon it, at one time
of the trial.&nbsp; The accident seemed to disturb him, as if he 
thought it ominous of the falling of his own head; and he 
admitted as much, now it was all over.</p>
<p>Being taken back to Whitehall, he sent to the House of 
Commons, saying that as the time of his execution might be nigh, 
he wished he might be allowed to see his darling children.&nbsp; 
It was granted.&nbsp; On the Monday he was taken back to St. 
James&rsquo;s; and his two children then in England, the <span 
class="smcap">Princess Elizabeth</span> thirteen years old, and 
the <span class="smcap">Duke Of Gloucester</span> nine years old,
were brought to take leave of him, from Sion House, near 
Brentford.&nbsp; It was a sad and touching scene, when he kissed 
and fondled those poor children, and made a little present of two
diamond seals to the Princess, and gave them tender messages to 
their mother (who little deserved them, for she had a lover of 
her own whom she married soon afterwards), and told them that he 
died &lsquo;for the laws and liberties of the land.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
I am bound to say that I don&rsquo;t think he did, but I dare say
he believed so.</p>
<p>There were ambassadors from Holland that day, to intercede for
the unhappy King, whom you and I both wish the Parliament had 
spared; but they got no answer.&nbsp; The Scottish Commissioners 
interceded too; so did the Prince of Wales, by a letter in which 
he offered as the next heir to the throne, to accept any 
conditions from the Parliament; so did the Queen, by letter 
likewise.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all, the warrant for the execution was this 
day signed.&nbsp; There is a story that as Oliver Cromwell went 
to the table with the pen in his hand to put his signature to it,
he drew his pen across the face of one of the commissioners, who 
was standing near, and marked it with ink.&nbsp; That 
commissioner had not signed his own name yet, and the story adds 
that when he came to do it he marked Cromwell&rsquo;s face with 
ink in the same way.</p>
<p>The King slept well, untroubled by the knowledge that it was 
his last night on earth, and rose on the thirtieth of January, 
two hours before day, and dressed himself carefully.&nbsp; He put
on two shirts lest he should tremble with the cold, and had his 
hair very carefully combed.&nbsp; The warrant had been directed 
to three officers of the army, <span class="smcap">Colonel 
Hacker</span>, <span class="smcap">Colonel Hunks</span>, and 
<span class="smcap">Colonel Phayer</span>.&nbsp; At ten 
o&rsquo;clock, the first of these came to the door and said it 
was time to go to Whitehall.&nbsp; The King, who had always been 
a quick walker, walked at his usual speed through the Park, and 
called out to the guard, with his accustomed voice of command, 
&lsquo;March on apace!&rsquo;&nbsp; When he came to Whitehall, he
was taken to his own bedroom, where a breakfast was set 
forth.&nbsp; As he had taken the Sacrament, he would eat nothing 
more; but, at about the time when the church bells struck twelve 
at noon (for he had to wait, through the scaffold not being 
ready), he took the advice of the good <span class="smcap">Bishop
Juxon</span> who was with him, and ate a little bread and drank a
glass of claret.&nbsp; Soon after he had taken this refreshment, 
Colonel Hacker came to the chamber with the warrant in his hand, 
and called for Charles Stuart.</p>
<p>And then, through the long gallery of Whitehall Palace, which 
he had often seen light and gay and merry and crowded, in very 
different times, the fallen King passed along, until he came to 
the centre window of the Banqueting House, through which he 
emerged upon the scaffold, which was hung with black.&nbsp; He 
looked at the two executioners, who were dressed in black and 
masked; he looked at the troops of soldiers on horseback and on 
foot, and all looked up at him in silence; he looked at the vast 
array of spectators, filling up the view beyond, and turning all 
their faces upon him; he looked at his old Palace of St. 
James&rsquo;s; and he looked at the block.&nbsp; He seemed a 
little troubled to find that it was so low, and asked, &lsquo;if 
there were no place higher?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, to those upon the 
scaffold, he said, &lsquo;that it was the Parliament who had 
begun the war, and not he; but he hoped they might be guiltless 
too, as ill instruments had gone between them.&nbsp; In one 
respect,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;he suffered justly; and that was 
because he had permitted an unjust sentence to be executed on 
another.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this he referred to the Earl of 
Strafford.</p>
<p>He was not at all afraid to die; but he was anxious to die 
easily.&nbsp; When some one touched the axe while he was 
speaking, he broke off and called out, &lsquo;Take heed of the 
axe! take heed of the axe!&rsquo;&nbsp; He also said to Colonel 
Hacker, &lsquo;Take care that they do not put me to 
pain.&rsquo;&nbsp; He told the executioner, &lsquo;I shall say 
but very short prayers, and then thrust out my 
hands&rsquo;&mdash;as the sign to strike.</p>
<p>He put his hair up, under a white satin cap which the bishop 
had carried, and said, &lsquo;I have a good cause and a gracious 
God on my side.&rsquo;&nbsp; The bishop told him that he had but 
one stage more to travel in this weary world, and that, though it
was a turbulent and troublesome stage, it was a short one, and 
would carry him a great way&mdash;all the way from earth to 
Heaven.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s last word, as he gave his cloak 
and the George&mdash;the decoration from his breast&mdash;to the 
bishop, was, &lsquo;Remember!&rsquo;&nbsp; He then kneeled down, 
laid his head on the block, spread out his hands, and was 
instantly killed.&nbsp; One universal groan broke from the crowd;
and the soldiers, who had sat on their horses and stood in their 
ranks immovable as statues, were of a sudden all in motion, 
clearing the streets.</p>
<p>Thus, in the forty-ninth year of his age, falling at the same 
time of his career as Strafford had fallen in his, perished 
Charles the First.&nbsp; With all my sorrow for him, I cannot 
agree with him that he died &lsquo;the martyr of the 
people;&rsquo; for the people had been martyrs to him, and to his
ideas of a King&rsquo;s rights, long before.&nbsp; Indeed, I am 
afraid that he was but a bad judge of martyrs; for he had called 
that infamous Duke of Buckingham &lsquo;the Martyr of his 
Sovereign.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER OLIVER CROMWELL</h2>
<p>Before sunset on the memorable day on which King Charles the 
First was executed, the House of Commons passed an act declaring 
it treason in any one to proclaim the Prince of Wales&mdash;or 
anybody else&mdash;King of England.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, it 
declared that the House of Lords was useless and dangerous, and 
ought to be abolished; and directed that the late King&rsquo;s 
statue should be taken down from the Royal Exchange in the City 
and other public places.&nbsp; Having laid hold of some famous 
Royalists who had escaped from prison, and having beheaded the 
<span class="smcap">Duke Of Hamilton</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Lord Holland</span>, and <span class="smcap">Lord 
Capel</span>, in Palace Yard (all of whom died very 
courageously), they then appointed a Council of State to govern 
the country.&nbsp; It consisted of forty-one members, of whom 
five were peers.&nbsp; Bradshaw was made president.&nbsp; The 
House of Commons also re-admitted members who had opposed the 
King&rsquo;s death, and made up its numbers to about a hundred 
and fifty.</p>
<p>But, it still had an army of more than forty thousand men to 
deal with, and a very hard task it was to manage them.&nbsp; 
Before the King&rsquo;s execution, the army had appointed some of
its officers to remonstrate between them and the Parliament; and 
now the common soldiers began to take that office upon 
themselves.&nbsp; The regiments under orders for Ireland 
mutinied; one troop of horse in the city of London seized their 
own flag, and refused to obey orders.&nbsp; For this, the 
ringleader was shot: which did not mend the matter, for, both his
comrades and the people made a public funeral for him, and 
accompanied the body to the grave with sound of trumpets and with
a gloomy procession of persons carrying bundles of rosemary 
steeped in blood.&nbsp; Oliver was the only man to deal with such
difficulties as these, and he soon cut them short by bursting at 
midnight into the town of Burford, near Salisbury, where the 
mutineers were sheltered, taking four hundred of them prisoners, 
and shooting a number of them by sentence of court-martial.&nbsp;
The soldiers soon found, as all men did, that Oliver was not a 
man to be trifled with.&nbsp; And there was an end of the 
mutiny.</p>
<p>The Scottish Parliament did not know Oliver yet; so, on 
hearing of the King&rsquo;s execution, it proclaimed the Prince 
of Wales King Charles the Second, on condition of his respecting 
the Solemn League and Covenant.&nbsp; Charles was abroad at that 
time, and so was Montrose, from whose help he had hopes enough to
keep him holding on and off with commissioners from Scotland, 
just as his father might have done.&nbsp; These hopes were soon 
at an end; for, Montrose, having raised a few hundred exiles in 
Germany, and landed with them in Scotland, found that the people 
there, instead of joining him, deserted the country at his 
approach.&nbsp; He was soon taken prisoner and carried to 
Edinburgh.&nbsp; There he was received with every possible 
insult, and carried to prison in a cart, his officers going two 
and two before him.&nbsp; He was sentenced by the Parliament to 
be hanged on a gallows thirty feet high, to have his head set on 
a spike in Edinburgh, and his limbs distributed in other places, 
according to the old barbarous manner.&nbsp; He said he had 
always acted under the Royal orders, and only wished he had limbs
enough to be distributed through Christendom, that it might be 
the more widely known how loyal he had been.&nbsp; He went to the
scaffold in a bright and brilliant dress, and made a bold end at 
thirty-eight years of age.&nbsp; The breath was scarcely out of 
his body when Charles abandoned his memory, and denied that he 
had ever given him orders to rise in his behalf.&nbsp; O the 
family failing was strong in that Charles then!</p>
<p>Oliver had been appointed by the Parliament to command the 
army in Ireland, where he took a terrible vengeance for the 
sanguinary rebellion, and made tremendous havoc, particularly in 
the siege of Drogheda, where no quarter was given, and where he 
found at least a thousand of the inhabitants shut up together in 
the great church: every one of whom was killed by his soldiers, 
usually known as <span class="smcap">Oliver&rsquo;s 
Ironsides</span>.&nbsp; There were numbers of friars and priests 
among them, and Oliver gruffly wrote home in his despatch that 
these were &lsquo;knocked on the head&rsquo; like the rest.</p>
<p>But, Charles having got over to Scotland where the men of the 
Solemn League and Covenant led him a prodigiously dull life and 
made him very weary with long sermons and grim Sundays, the 
Parliament called the redoubtable Oliver home to knock the 
Scottish men on the head for setting up that Prince.&nbsp; Oliver
left his son-in-law, Ireton, as general in Ireland in his stead 
(he died there afterwards), and he imitated the example of his 
father-in-law with such good will that he brought the country to 
subjection, and laid it at the feet of the Parliament.&nbsp; In 
the end, they passed an act for the settlement of Ireland, 
generally pardoning all the common people, but exempting from 
this grace such of the wealthier sort as had been concerned in 
the rebellion, or in any killing of Protestants, or who refused 
to lay down their arms.&nbsp; Great numbers of Irish were got out
of the country to serve under Catholic powers abroad, and a 
quantity of land was declared to have been forfeited by past 
offences, and was given to people who had lent money to the 
Parliament early in the war.&nbsp; These were sweeping measures; 
but, if Oliver Cromwell had had his own way fully, and had stayed
in Ireland, he would have done more yet.</p>
<p>However, as I have said, the Parliament wanted Oliver for 
Scotland; so, home Oliver came, and was made Commander of all the
Forces of the Commonwealth of England, and in three days away he 
went with sixteen thousand soldiers to fight the Scottish 
men.&nbsp; Now, the Scottish men, being then&mdash;as you will 
generally find them now&mdash;mighty cautious, reflected that the
troops they had were not used to war like the Ironsides, and 
would be beaten in an open fight.&nbsp; Therefore they said, 
&lsquo;If we live quiet in our trenches in Edinburgh here, and if
all the farmers come into the town and desert the country, the 
Ironsides will be driven out by iron hunger and be forced to go 
away.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was, no doubt, the wisest plan; but as 
the Scottish clergy <i>would</i> interfere with what they knew 
nothing about, and would perpetually preach long sermons 
exhorting the soldiers to come out and fight, the soldiers got it
in their heads that they absolutely must come out and 
fight.&nbsp; Accordingly, in an evil hour for themselves, they 
came out of their safe position.&nbsp; Oliver fell upon them 
instantly, and killed three thousand, and took ten thousand 
prisoners.</p>
<p>To gratify the Scottish Parliament, and preserve their favour,
Charles had signed a declaration they laid before him, 
reproaching the memory of his father and mother, and representing
himself as a most religious Prince, to whom the Solemn League and
Covenant was as dear as life.&nbsp; He meant no sort of truth in 
this, and soon afterwards galloped away on horseback to join some
tiresome Highland friends, who were always flourishing dirks and 
broadswords.&nbsp; He was overtaken and induced to return; but 
this attempt, which was called &lsquo;The Start,&rsquo; did him 
just so much service, that they did not preach quite such long 
sermons at him afterwards as they had done before.</p>
<p>On the first of January, one thousand six hundred and 
fifty-one, the Scottish people crowned him at Scone.&nbsp; He 
immediately took the chief command of an army of twenty thousand 
men, and marched to Stirling.&nbsp; His hopes were heightened, I 
dare say, by the redoubtable Oliver being ill of an ague; but 
Oliver scrambled out of bed in no time, and went to work with 
such energy that he got behind the Royalist army and cut it off 
from all communication with Scotland.&nbsp; There was nothing for
it then, but to go on to England; so it went on as far as 
Worcester, where the mayor and some of the gentry proclaimed King
Charles the Second straightway.&nbsp; His proclamation, however, 
was of little use to him, for very few Royalists appeared; and, 
on the very same day, two people were publicly beheaded on Tower 
Hill for espousing his cause.&nbsp; Up came Oliver to Worcester 
too, at double quick speed, and he and his Ironsides so laid 
about them in the great battle which was fought there, that they 
completely beat the Scottish men, and destroyed the Royalist 
army; though the Scottish men fought so gallantly that it took 
five hours to do.</p>
<p>The escape of Charles after this battle of Worcester did him 
good service long afterwards, for it induced many of the generous
English people to take a romantic interest in him, and to think 
much better of him than he ever deserved.&nbsp; He fled in the 
night, with not more than sixty followers, to the house of a 
Catholic lady in Staffordshire.&nbsp; There, for his greater 
safety, the whole sixty left him.&nbsp; He cropped his hair, 
stained his face and hands brown as if they were sunburnt, put on
the clothes of a labouring countryman, and went out in the 
morning with his axe in his hand, accompanied by four 
wood-cutters who were brothers, and another man who was their 
brother-in-law.&nbsp; These good fellows made a bed for him under
a tree, as the weather was very bad; and the wife of one of them 
brought him food to eat; and the old mother of the four brothers 
came and fell down on her knees before him in the wood, and 
thanked God that her sons were engaged in saving his life.&nbsp; 
At night, he came out of the forest and went on to another house 
which was near the river Severn, with the intention of passing 
into Wales; but the place swarmed with soldiers, and the bridges 
were guarded, and all the boats were made fast.&nbsp; So, after 
lying in a hayloft covered over with hay, for some time, he came 
out of his place, attended by <span class="smcap">Colonel 
Careless</span>, a Catholic gentleman who had met him there, and 
with whom he lay hid, all next day, up in the shady branches of a
fine old oak.&nbsp; It was lucky for the King that it was 
September-time, and that the leaves had not begun to fall, since 
he and the Colonel, perched up in this tree, could catch glimpses
of the soldiers riding about below, and could hear the crash in 
the wood as they went about beating the boughs.</p>
<p>After this, he walked and walked until his feet were all 
blistered; and, having been concealed all one day in a house 
which was searched by the troopers while he was there, went with 
<span class="smcap">Lord Wilmot</span>, another of his good 
friends, to a place called Bentley, where one <span 
class="smcap">Miss Lane</span>, a Protestant lady, had obtained a
pass to be allowed to ride through the guards to see a relation 
of hers near Bristol.&nbsp; Disguised as a servant, he rode in 
the saddle before this young lady to the house of <span 
class="smcap">Sir John Winter</span>, while Lord Wilmot rode 
there boldly, like a plain country gentleman, with dogs at his 
heels.&nbsp; It happened that Sir John Winter&rsquo;s butler had 
been servant in Richmond Palace, and knew Charles the moment he 
set eyes upon him; but, the butler was faithful and kept the 
secret.&nbsp; As no ship could be found to carry him abroad, it 
was planned that he should go&mdash;still travelling with Miss 
Lane as her servant&mdash;to another house, at Trent near 
Sherborne in Dorsetshire; and then Miss Lane and her cousin, 
<span class="smcap">Mr. Lascelles</span>, who had gone on 
horseback beside her all the way, went home.&nbsp; I hope Miss 
Lane was going to marry that cousin, for I am sure she must have 
been a brave, kind girl.&nbsp; If I had been that cousin, I 
should certainly have loved Miss Lane.</p>
<p>When Charles, lonely for the loss of Miss Lane, was safe at 
Trent, a ship was hired at Lyme, the master of which engaged to 
take two gentlemen to France.&nbsp; In the evening of the same 
day, the King&mdash;now riding as servant before another young 
lady&mdash;set off for a public-house at a place called 
Charmouth, where the captain of the vessel was to take him on 
board.&nbsp; But, the captain&rsquo;s wife, being afraid of her 
husband getting into trouble, locked him up and would not let him
sail.&nbsp; Then they went away to Bridport; and, coming to the 
inn there, found the stable-yard full of soldiers who were on the
look-out for Charles, and who talked about him while they 
drank.&nbsp; He had such presence of mind, that he led the horses
of his party through the yard as any other servant might have 
done, and said, &lsquo;Come out of the way, you soldiers; let us 
have room to pass here!&rsquo;&nbsp; As he went along, he met a 
half-tipsy ostler, who rubbed his eyes and said to him, 
&lsquo;Why, I was formerly servant to Mr. Potter at Exeter, and 
surely I have sometimes seen you there, young man?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
He certainly had, for Charles had lodged there.&nbsp; His ready 
answer was, &lsquo;Ah, I did live with him once; but I have no 
time to talk now.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have a pot of beer together 
when I come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From this dangerous place he returned to Trent, and lay there 
concealed several days.&nbsp; Then he escaped to Heale, near 
Salisbury; where, in the house of a widow lady, he was hidden 
five days, until the master of a collier lying off Shoreham in 
Sussex, undertook to convey a &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo; to 
France.&nbsp; On the night of the fifteenth of October, 
accompanied by two colonels and a merchant, the King rode to 
Brighton, then a little fishing village, to give the captain of 
the ship a supper before going on board; but, so many people knew
him, that this captain knew him too, and not only he, but the 
landlord and landlady also.&nbsp; Before he went away, the 
landlord came behind his chair, kissed his hand, and said he 
hoped to live to be a lord and to see his wife a lady; at which 
Charles laughed.&nbsp; They had had a good supper by this time, 
and plenty of smoking and drinking, at which the King was a 
first-rate hand; so, the captain assured him that he would stand 
by him, and he did.&nbsp; It was agreed that the captain should 
pretend to sail to Deal, and that Charles should address the 
sailors and say he was a gentleman in debt who was running away 
from his creditors, and that he hoped they would join him in 
persuading the captain to put him ashore in France.&nbsp; As the 
King acted his part very well indeed, and gave the sailors twenty
shillings to drink, they begged the captain to do what such a 
worthy gentleman asked.&nbsp; He pretended to yield to their 
entreaties, and the King got safe to Normandy.</p>
<p>Ireland being now subdued, and Scotland kept quiet by plenty 
of forts and soldiers put there by Oliver, the Parliament would 
have gone on quietly enough, as far as fighting with any foreign 
enemy went, but for getting into trouble with the Dutch, who in 
the spring of the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-one 
sent a fleet into the Downs under their <span 
class="smcap">Admiral Van Tromp</span>, to call upon the bold 
English <span class="smcap">Admiral Blake</span> (who was there 
with half as many ships as the Dutch) to strike his flag.&nbsp; 
Blake fired a raging broadside instead, and beat off Van Tromp; 
who, in the autumn, came back again with seventy ships, and 
challenged the bold Blake&mdash;who still was only half as 
strong&mdash;to fight him.&nbsp; Blake fought him all day; but, 
finding that the Dutch were too many for him, got quietly off at 
night.&nbsp; What does Van Tromp upon this, but goes cruising and
boasting about the Channel, between the North Foreland and the 
Isle of Wight, with a great Dutch broom tied to his masthead, as 
a sign that he could and would sweep the English of the 
sea!&nbsp; Within three months, Blake lowered his tone though, 
and his broom too; for, he and two other bold commanders, <span 
class="smcap">Dean</span> and <span class="smcap">Monk</span>, 
fought him three whole days, took twenty-three of his ships, 
shivered his broom to pieces, and settled his business.</p>
<p>Things were no sooner quiet again, than the army began to 
complain to the Parliament that they were not governing the 
nation properly, and to hint that they thought they could do it 
better themselves.&nbsp; Oliver, who had now made up his mind to 
be the head of the state, or nothing at all, supported them in 
this, and called a meeting of officers and his own Parliamentary 
friends, at his lodgings in Whitehall, to consider the best way 
of getting rid of the Parliament.&nbsp; It had now lasted just as
many years as the King&rsquo;s unbridled power had lasted, before
it came into existence.&nbsp; The end of the deliberation was, 
that Oliver went down to the House in his usual plain black 
dress, with his usual grey worsted stockings, but with an unusual
party of soldiers behind him.&nbsp; These last he left in the 
lobby, and then went in and sat down.&nbsp; Presently he got up, 
made the Parliament a speech, told them that the Lord had done 
with them, stamped his foot and said, &lsquo;You are no 
Parliament.&nbsp; Bring them in!&nbsp; Bring them 
in!&rsquo;&nbsp; At this signal the door flew open, and the 
soldiers appeared.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is not honest,&rsquo; said 
Sir Harry Vane, one of the members.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir Harry 
Vane!&rsquo; cried Cromwell; &lsquo;O, Sir Harry Vane!&nbsp; The 
Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he pointed
out members one by one, and said this man was a drunkard, and 
that man a dissipated fellow, and that man a liar, and so 
on.&nbsp; Then he caused the Speaker to be walked out of his 
chair, told the guard to clear the House, called the mace upon 
the table&mdash;which is a sign that the House is 
sitting&mdash;&lsquo;a fool&rsquo;s bauble,&rsquo; and said, 
&lsquo;here, carry it away!&rsquo;&nbsp; Being obeyed in all 
these orders, he quietly locked the door, put the key in his 
pocket, walked back to Whitehall again, and told his friends, who
were still assembled there, what he had done.</p>
<p>They formed a new Council of State after this extraordinary 
proceeding, and got a new Parliament together in their own way: 
which Oliver himself opened in a sort of sermon, and which he 
said was the beginning of a perfect heaven upon earth.&nbsp; In 
this Parliament there sat a well-known leather-seller, who had 
taken the singular name of Praise God Barebones, and from whom it
was called, for a joke, Barebones&rsquo;s Parliament, though its 
general name was the Little Parliament.&nbsp; As it soon appeared
that it was not going to put Oliver in the first place, it turned
out to be not at all like the beginning of heaven upon earth, and
Oliver said it really was not to be borne with.&nbsp; So he 
cleared off that Parliament in much the same way as he had 
disposed of the other; and then the council of officers decided 
that he must be made the supreme authority of the kingdom, under 
the title of the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>So, on the sixteenth of December, one thousand six hundred and
fifty-three, a great procession was formed at Oliver&rsquo;s 
door, and he came out in a black velvet suit and a big pair of 
boots, and got into his coach and went down to Westminster, 
attended by the judges, and the lord mayor, and the aldermen, and
all the other great and wonderful personages of the 
country.&nbsp; There, in the Court of Chancery, he publicly 
accepted the office of Lord Protector.&nbsp; Then he was sworn, 
and the City sword was handed to him, and the seal was handed to 
him, and all the other things were handed to him which are 
usually handed to Kings and Queens on state occasions.&nbsp; When
Oliver had handed them all back, he was quite made and completely
finished off as Lord Protector; and several of the Ironsides 
preached about it at great length, all the evening.</p>
<h3>SECOND PART</h3>
<p>Oliver Cromwell&mdash;whom the people long called <span 
class="smcap">Old Noll</span>&mdash;in accepting the office of 
Protector, had bound himself by a certain paper which was handed 
to him, called &lsquo;the Instrument,&rsquo; to summon a 
Parliament, consisting of between four and five hundred members, 
in the election of which neither the Royalists nor the Catholics 
were to have any share.&nbsp; He had also pledged himself that 
this Parliament should not be dissolved without its own consent 
until it had sat five months.</p>
<p>When this Parliament met, Oliver made a speech to them of 
three hours long, very wisely advising them what to do for the 
credit and happiness of the country.&nbsp; To keep down the more 
violent members, he required them to sign a recognition of what 
they were forbidden by &lsquo;the Instrument&rsquo; to do; which 
was, chiefly, to take the power from one single person at the 
head of the state or to command the army.&nbsp; Then he dismissed
them to go to work.&nbsp; With his usual vigour and resolution he
went to work himself with some frantic preachers&mdash;who were 
rather overdoing their sermons in calling him a villain and a 
tyrant&mdash;by shutting up their chapels, and sending a few of 
them off to prison.</p>
<p>There was not at that time, in England or anywhere else, a man
so able to govern the country as Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; Although 
he ruled with a strong hand, and levied a very heavy tax on the 
Royalists (but not until they had plotted against his life), he 
ruled wisely, and as the times required.&nbsp; He caused England 
to be so respected abroad, that I wish some lords and gentlemen 
who have governed it under kings and queens in later days would 
have taken a leaf out of Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; He 
sent bold Admiral Blake to the Mediterranean Sea, to make the 
Duke of Tuscany pay sixty thousand pounds for injuries he had 
done to British subjects, and spoliation he had committed on 
English merchants.&nbsp; He further despatched him and his fleet 
to Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, to have every English ship and 
every English man delivered up to him that had been taken by 
pirates in those parts.&nbsp; All this was gloriously done; and 
it began to be thoroughly well known, all over the world, that 
England was governed by a man in earnest, who would not allow the
English name to be insulted or slighted anywhere.</p>
<p>These were not all his foreign triumphs.&nbsp; He sent a fleet
to sea against the Dutch; and the two powers, each with one 
hundred ships upon its side, met in the English Channel off the 
North Foreland, where the fight lasted all day long.&nbsp; Dean 
was killed in this fight; but Monk, who commanded in the same 
ship with him, threw his cloak over his body, that the sailors 
might not know of his death, and be disheartened.&nbsp; Nor were 
they.&nbsp; The English broadsides so exceedingly astonished the 
Dutch that they sheered off at last, though the redoubtable Van 
Tromp fired upon them with his own guns for deserting their 
flag.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, the two fleets engaged again, off 
the coast of Holland.&nbsp; There, the valiant Van Tromp was shot
through the heart, and the Dutch gave in, and peace was made.</p>
<p>Further than this, Oliver resolved not to bear the domineering
and bigoted conduct of Spain, which country not only claimed a 
right to all the gold and silver that could be found in South 
America, and treated the ships of all other countries who visited
those regions, as pirates, but put English subjects into the 
horrible Spanish prisons of the Inquisition.&nbsp; So, Oliver 
told the Spanish ambassador that English ships must be free to go
wherever they would, and that English merchants must not be 
thrown into those same dungeons, no, not for the pleasure of all 
the priests in Spain.&nbsp; To this, the Spanish ambassador 
replied that the gold and silver country, and the Holy 
Inquisition, were his King&rsquo;s two eyes, neither of which he 
could submit to have put out.&nbsp; Very well, said Oliver, then 
he was afraid he (Oliver) must damage those two eyes 
directly.</p>
<p>So, another fleet was despatched under two commanders, <span 
class="smcap">Penn</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Venables</span>, for Hispaniola; where, however, 
the Spaniards got the better of the fight.&nbsp; Consequently, 
the fleet came home again, after taking Jamaica on the way.&nbsp;
Oliver, indignant with the two commanders who had not done what 
bold Admiral Blake would have done, clapped them both into 
prison, declared war against Spain, and made a treaty with 
France, in virtue of which it was to shelter the King and his 
brother the Duke of York no longer.&nbsp; Then, he sent a fleet 
abroad under bold Admiral Blake, which brought the King of 
Portugal to his senses&mdash;just to keep its hand in&mdash;and 
then engaged a Spanish fleet, sunk four great ships, and took two
more, laden with silver to the value of two millions of pounds: 
which dazzling prize was brought from Portsmouth to London in 
waggons, with the populace of all the towns and villages through 
which the waggons passed, shouting with all their might.&nbsp; 
After this victory, bold Admiral Blake sailed away to the port of
Santa Cruz to cut off the Spanish treasure-ships coming from 
Mexico.&nbsp; There, he found them, ten in number, with seven 
others to take care of them, and a big castle, and seven 
batteries, all roaring and blazing away at him with great 
guns.&nbsp; Blake cared no more for great guns than for 
pop-guns&mdash;no more for their hot iron balls than for 
snow-balls.&nbsp; He dashed into the harbour, captured and burnt 
every one of the ships, and came sailing out again triumphantly, 
with the victorious English flag flying at his masthead.&nbsp; 
This was the last triumph of this great commander, who had sailed
and fought until he was quite worn out.&nbsp; He died, as his 
successful ship was coming into Plymouth Harbour amidst the 
joyful acclamations of the people, and was buried in state in 
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; Not to lie there, long.</p>
<p>Over and above all this, Oliver found that the <span 
class="smcap">Vaudois</span>, or Protestant people of the valleys
of Lucerne, were insolently treated by the Catholic powers, and 
were even put to death for their religion, in an audacious and 
bloody manner.&nbsp; Instantly, he informed those powers that 
this was a thing which Protestant England would not allow; and he
speedily carried his point, through the might of his great name, 
and established their right to worship God in peace after their 
own harmless manner.</p>
<p>Lastly, his English army won such admiration in fighting with 
the French against the Spaniards, that, after they had assaulted 
the town of Dunkirk together, the French King in person gave it 
up to the English, that it might be a token to them of their 
might and valour.</p>
<p>There were plots enough against Oliver among the frantic 
religionists (who called themselves Fifth Monarchy Men), and 
among the disappointed Republicans.&nbsp; He had a difficult game
to play, for the Royalists were always ready to side with either 
party against him.&nbsp; The &lsquo;King over the water,&rsquo; 
too, as Charles was called, had no scruples about plotting with 
any one against his life; although there is reason to suppose 
that he would willingly have married one of his daughters, if 
Oliver would have had such a son-in-law.&nbsp; There was a 
certain <span class="smcap">Colonel Saxby</span> of the army, 
once a great supporter of Oliver&rsquo;s but now turned against 
him, who was a grievous trouble to him through all this part of 
his career; and who came and went between the discontented in 
England and Spain, and Charles who put himself in alliance with 
Spain on being thrown off by France.&nbsp; This man died in 
prison at last; but not until there had been very serious plots 
between the Royalists and Republicans, and an actual rising of 
them in England, when they burst into the city of Salisbury, on a
Sunday night, seized the judges who were going to hold the 
assizes there next day, and would have hanged them but for the 
merciful objections of the more temperate of their number.&nbsp; 
Oliver was so vigorous and shrewd that he soon put this revolt 
down, as he did most other conspiracies; and it was well for one 
of its chief managers&mdash;that same Lord Wilmot who had 
assisted in Charles&rsquo;s flight, and was now <span 
class="smcap">Earl of Rochester</span>&mdash;that he made his 
escape.&nbsp; Oliver seemed to have eyes and ears everywhere, and
secured such sources of information as his enemies little dreamed
of.&nbsp; There was a chosen body of six persons, called the 
Sealed Knot, who were in the closest and most secret confidence 
of Charles.&nbsp; One of the foremost of these very men, a <span 
class="smcap">Sir Richard Willis</span>, reported to Oliver 
everything that passed among them, and had two hundred a year for
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles Syndarcomb</span>, also of the old 
army, was another conspirator against the Protector.&nbsp; He and
a man named <span class="smcap">Cecil</span>, bribed one of his 
Life Guards to let them have good notice when he was going 
out&mdash;intending to shoot him from a window.&nbsp; But, owing 
either to his caution or his good fortune, they could never get 
an aim at him.&nbsp; Disappointed in this design, they got into 
the chapel in Whitehall, with a basketful of combustibles, which 
were to explode by means of a slow match in six hours; then, in 
the noise and confusion of the fire, they hoped to kill 
Oliver.&nbsp; But, the Life Guardsman himself disclosed this 
plot; and they were seized, and Miles died (or killed himself in 
prison) a little while before he was ordered for execution.&nbsp;
A few such plotters Oliver caused to be beheaded, a few more to 
be hanged, and many more, including those who rose in arms 
against him, to be sent as slaves to the West Indies.&nbsp; If he
were rigid, he was impartial too, in asserting the laws of 
England.&nbsp; When a Portuguese nobleman, the brother of the 
Portuguese ambassador, killed a London citizen in mistake for 
another man with whom he had had a quarrel, Oliver caused him to 
be tried before a jury of Englishmen and foreigners, and had him 
executed in spite of the entreaties of all the ambassadors in 
London.</p>
<p>One of Oliver&rsquo;s own friends, the <span 
class="smcap">Duke of Oldenburgh</span>, in sending him a present
of six fine coach-horses, was very near doing more to please the 
Royalists than all the plotters put together.&nbsp; One day, 
Oliver went with his coach, drawn by these six horses, into Hyde 
Park, to dine with his secretary and some of his other gentlemen 
under the trees there.&nbsp; After dinner, being merry, he took 
it into his head to put his friends inside and to drive them 
home: a postillion riding one of the foremost horses, as the 
custom was.&nbsp; On account of Oliver&rsquo;s being too free 
with the whip, the six fine horses went off at a gallop, the 
postillion got thrown, and Oliver fell upon the coach-pole and 
narrowly escaped being shot by his own pistol, which got 
entangled with his clothes in the harness, and went off.&nbsp; He
was dragged some distance by the foot, until his foot came out of
the shoe, and then he came safely to the ground under the broad 
body of the coach, and was very little the worse.&nbsp; The 
gentlemen inside were only bruised, and the discontented people 
of all parties were much disappointed.</p>
<p>The rest of the history of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell
is a history of his Parliaments.&nbsp; His first one not pleasing
him at all, he waited until the five months were out, and then 
dissolved it.&nbsp; The next was better suited to his views; and 
from that he desired to get&mdash;if he could with safety to 
himself&mdash;the title of King.&nbsp; He had had this in his 
mind some time: whether because he thought that the English 
people, being more used to the title, were more likely to obey 
it; or whether because he really wished to be a king himself, and
to leave the succession to that title in his family, is far from 
clear.&nbsp; He was already as high, in England and in all the 
world, as he would ever be, and I doubt if he cared for the mere 
name.&nbsp; However, a paper, called the &lsquo;Humble Petition 
and Advice,&rsquo; was presented to him by the House of Commons, 
praying him to take a high title and to appoint his 
successor.&nbsp; That he would have taken the title of King there
is no doubt, but for the strong opposition of the army.&nbsp; 
This induced him to forbear, and to assent only to the other 
points of the petition.&nbsp; Upon which occasion there was 
another grand show in Westminster Hall, when the Speaker of the 
House of Commons formally invested him with a purple robe lined 
with ermine, and presented him with a splendidly bound Bible, and
put a golden sceptre in his hand.&nbsp; The next time the 
Parliament met, he called a House of Lords of sixty members, as 
the petition gave him power to do; but as that Parliament did not
please him either, and would not proceed to the business of the 
country, he jumped into a coach one morning, took six Guards with
him, and sent them to the right-about.&nbsp; I wish this had been
a warning to Parliaments to avoid long speeches, and do more 
work.</p>
<p>It was the month of August, one thousand six hundred and 
fifty-eight, when Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s favourite daughter, 
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Claypole</span> (who had lately 
lost her youngest son), lay very ill, and his mind was greatly 
troubled, because he loved her dearly.&nbsp; Another of his 
daughters was married to <span class="smcap">Lord 
Falconberg</span>, another to the grandson of the Earl of 
Warwick, and he had made his son <span 
class="smcap">Richard</span> one of the Members of the Upper 
House.&nbsp; He was very kind and loving to them all, being a 
good father and a good husband; but he loved this daughter the 
best of the family, and went down to Hampton Court to see her, 
and could hardly be induced to stir from her sick room until she 
died.&nbsp; Although his religion had been of a gloomy kind, his 
disposition had been always cheerful.&nbsp; He had been fond of 
music in his home, and had kept open table once a week for all 
officers of the army not below the rank of captain, and had 
always preserved in his house a quiet, sensible dignity.&nbsp; He
encouraged men of genius and learning, and loved to have them 
about him.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Milton</span> was one of his
great friends.&nbsp; He was good humoured too, with the nobility,
whose dresses and manners were very different from his; and to 
show them what good information he had, he would sometimes 
jokingly tell them when they were his guests, where they had last
drunk the health of the &lsquo;King over the water,&rsquo; and 
would recommend them to be more private (if they could) another 
time.&nbsp; But he had lived in busy times, had borne the weight 
of heavy State affairs, and had often gone in fear of his 
life.&nbsp; He was ill of the gout and ague; and when the death 
of his beloved child came upon him in addition, he sank, never to
raise his head again.&nbsp; He told his physicians on the 
twenty-fourth of August that the Lord had assured him that he was
not to die in that illness, and that he would certainly get 
better.&nbsp; This was only his sick fancy, for on the third of 
September, which was the anniversary of the great battle of 
Worcester, and the day of the year which he called his fortunate 
day, he died, in the sixtieth year of his age.&nbsp; He had been 
delirious, and had lain insensible some hours, but he had been 
overheard to murmur a very good prayer the day before.&nbsp; The 
whole country lamented his death.&nbsp; If you want to know the 
real worth of Oliver Cromwell, and his real services to his 
country, you can hardly do better than compare England under him,
with England under <span class="smcap">Charles the 
Second</span>.</p>
<p>He had appointed his son Richard to succeed him, and after 
there had been, at Somerset House in the Strand, a lying in state
more splendid than sensible&mdash;as all such vanities after 
death are, I think&mdash;Richard became Lord Protector.&nbsp; He 
was an amiable country gentleman, but had none of his 
father&rsquo;s great genius, and was quite unfit for such a post 
in such a storm of parties.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s Protectorate, 
which only lasted a year and a half, is a history of quarrels 
between the officers of the army and the Parliament, and between 
the officers among themselves; and of a growing discontent among 
the people, who had far too many long sermons and far too few 
amusements, and wanted a change.&nbsp; At last, General Monk got 
the army well into his own hands, and then in pursuance of a 
secret plan he seems to have entertained from the time of 
Oliver&rsquo;s death, declared for the King&rsquo;s cause.&nbsp; 
He did not do this openly; but, in his place in the House of 
Commons, as one of the members for Devonshire, strongly advocated
the proposals of one <span class="smcap">Sir John 
Greenville</span>, who came to the House with a letter from 
Charles, dated from Breda, and with whom he had previously been 
in secret communication.&nbsp; There had been plots and 
counterplots, and a recall of the last members of the Long 
Parliament, and an end of the Long Parliament, and risings of the
Royalists that were made too soon; and most men being tired out, 
and there being no one to head the country now great Oliver was 
dead, it was readily agreed to welcome Charles Stuart.&nbsp; Some
of the wiser and better members said&mdash;what was most 
true&mdash;that in the letter from Breda, he gave no real promise
to govern well, and that it would be best to make him pledge 
himself beforehand as to what he should be bound to do for the 
benefit of the kingdom.&nbsp; Monk said, however, it would be all
right when he came, and he could not come too soon.</p>
<p>So, everybody found out all in a moment that the country 
<i>must</i> be prosperous and happy, having another Stuart to 
condescend to reign over it; and there was a prodigious firing 
off of guns, lighting of bonfires, ringing of bells, and throwing
up of caps.&nbsp; The people drank the King&rsquo;s health by 
thousands in the open streets, and everybody rejoiced.&nbsp; Down
came the Arms of the Commonwealth, up went the Royal Arms 
instead, and out came the public money.&nbsp; Fifty thousand 
pounds for the King, ten thousand pounds for his brother the Duke
of York, five thousand pounds for his brother the Duke of 
Gloucester.&nbsp; Prayers for these gracious Stuarts were put up 
in all the churches; commissioners were sent to Holland (which 
suddenly found out that Charles was a great man, and that it 
loved him) to invite the King home; Monk and the Kentish grandees
went to Dover, to kneel down before him as he landed.&nbsp; He 
kissed and embraced Monk, made him ride in the coach with himself
and his brothers, came on to London amid wonderful shoutings, and
passed through the army at Blackheath on the twenty-ninth of May 
(his birthday), in the year one thousand six hundred and 
sixty.&nbsp; Greeted by splendid dinners under tents, by flags 
and tapestry streaming from all the houses, by delighted crowds 
in all the streets, by troops of noblemen and gentlemen in rich 
dresses, by City companies, train-bands, drummers, trumpeters, 
the great Lord Mayor, and the majestic Aldermen, the King went on
to Whitehall.&nbsp; On entering it, he commemorated his 
Restoration with the joke that it really would seem to have been 
his own fault that he had not come long ago, since everybody told
him that he had always wished for him with all his heart.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE SECOND, CALLED 
THE MERRY MONARCH</h2>
<p>There never were such profligate times in England as under 
Charles the Second.&nbsp; Whenever you see his portrait, with his
swarthy, ill-looking face and great nose, you may fancy him in 
his Court at Whitehall, surrounded by some of the very worst 
vagabonds in the kingdom (though they were lords and ladies), 
drinking, gambling, indulging in vicious conversation, and 
committing every kind of profligate excess.&nbsp; It has been a 
fashion to call Charles the Second &lsquo;The Merry 
Monarch.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let me try to give you a general idea of 
some of the merry things that were done, in the merry days when 
this merry gentleman sat upon his merry throne, in merry 
England.</p>
<p>The first merry proceeding was&mdash;of course&mdash;to 
declare that he was one of the greatest, the wisest, and the 
noblest kings that ever shone, like the blessed sun itself, on 
this benighted earth.&nbsp; The next merry and pleasant piece of 
business was, for the Parliament, in the humblest manner, to give
him one million two hundred thousand pounds a year, and to settle
upon him for life that old disputed tonnage and poundage which 
had been so bravely fought for.&nbsp; Then, General Monk being 
made <span class="smcap">Earl of Albemarle</span>, and a few 
other Royalists similarly rewarded, the law went to work to see 
what was to be done to those persons (they were called Regicides)
who had been concerned in making a martyr of the late King.&nbsp;
Ten of these were merrily executed; that is to say, six of the 
judges, one of the council, Colonel Hacker and another officer 
who had commanded the Guards, and <span class="smcap">Hugh 
Peters</span>, a preacher who had preached against the martyr 
with all his heart.&nbsp; These executions were so extremely 
merry, that every horrible circumstance which Cromwell had 
abandoned was revived with appalling cruelty.&nbsp; The hearts of
the sufferers were torn out of their living bodies; their bowels 
were burned before their faces; the executioner cut jokes to the 
next victim, as he rubbed his filthy hands together, that were 
reeking with the blood of the last; and the heads of the dead 
were drawn on sledges with the living to the place of 
suffering.&nbsp; Still, even so merry a monarch could not force 
one of these dying men to say that he was sorry for what he had 
done.&nbsp; Nay, the most memorable thing said among them was, 
that if the thing were to do again they would do it.</p>
<p>Sir Harry Vane, who had furnished the evidence against 
Strafford, and was one of the most staunch of the Republicans, 
was also tried, found guilty, and ordered for execution.&nbsp; 
When he came upon the scaffold on Tower Hill, after conducting 
his own defence with great power, his notes of what he had meant 
to say to the people were torn away from him, and the drums and 
trumpets were ordered to sound lustily and drown his voice; for, 
the people had been so much impressed by what the Regicides had 
calmly said with their last breath, that it was the custom now, 
to have the drums and trumpets always under the scaffold, ready 
to strike up.&nbsp; Vane said no more than this: &lsquo;It is a 
bad cause which cannot bear the words of a dying man:&rsquo; and 
bravely died.</p>
<p>These merry scenes were succeeded by another, perhaps even 
merrier.&nbsp; On the anniversary of the late King&rsquo;s death,
the bodies of Oliver Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw, were torn 
out of their graves in Westminster Abbey, dragged to Tyburn, 
hanged there on a gallows all day long, and then beheaded.&nbsp; 
Imagine the head of Oliver Cromwell set upon a pole to be stared 
at by a brutal crowd, not one of whom would have dared to look 
the living Oliver in the face for half a moment!&nbsp; Think, 
after you have read this reign, what England was under Oliver 
Cromwell who was torn out of his grave, and what it was under 
this merry monarch who sold it, like a merry Judas, over and over
again.</p>
<p>Of course, the remains of Oliver&rsquo;s wife and daughter 
were not to be spared either, though they had been most excellent
women.&nbsp; The base clergy of that time gave up their bodies, 
which had been buried in the Abbey, and&mdash;to the eternal 
disgrace of England&mdash;they were thrown into a pit, together 
with the mouldering bones of Pym and of the brave and bold old 
Admiral Blake.</p>
<p>The clergy acted this disgraceful part because they hoped to 
get the nonconformists, or dissenters, thoroughly put down in 
this reign, and to have but one prayer-book and one service for 
all kinds of people, no matter what their private opinions 
were.&nbsp; This was pretty well, I think, for a Protestant 
Church, which had displaced the Romish Church because people had 
a right to their own opinions in religious matters.&nbsp; 
However, they carried it with a high hand, and a prayer-book was 
agreed upon, in which the extremest opinions of Archbishop Laud 
were not forgotten.&nbsp; An Act was passed, too, preventing any 
dissenter from holding any office under any corporation.&nbsp; 
So, the regular clergy in their triumph were soon as merry as the
King.&nbsp; The army being by this time disbanded, and the King 
crowned, everything was to go on easily for evermore.</p>
<p>I must say a word here about the King&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; He
had not been long upon the throne when his brother the Duke of 
Gloucester, and his sister the <span class="smcap">Princess of 
Orange</span>, died within a few months of each other, of 
small-pox.&nbsp; His remaining sister, the <span 
class="smcap">Princess Henrietta</span>, married the <span 
class="smcap">Duke of Orleans</span>, the brother of <span 
class="smcap">Louis the Fourteenth</span>, King of France.&nbsp; 
His brother <span class="smcap">James</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Duke of York</span>, was made High Admiral, and 
by-and-by became a Catholic.&nbsp; He was a gloomy, sullen, 
bilious sort of man, with a remarkable partiality for the ugliest
women in the country.&nbsp; He married, under very discreditable 
circumstances, <span class="smcap">Anne Hyde</span>, the daughter
of <span class="smcap">Lord Clarendon</span>, then the 
King&rsquo;s principal Minister&mdash;not at all a delicate 
minister either, but doing much of the dirty work of a very dirty
palace.&nbsp; It became important now that the King himself 
should be married; and divers foreign Monarchs, not very 
particular about the character of their son-in-law, proposed 
their daughters to him.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">King of 
Portugal</span> offered his daughter, <span 
class="smcap">Catherine of Braganza</span>, and fifty thousand 
pounds: in addition to which, the French King, who was favourable
to that match, offered a loan of another fifty thousand.&nbsp; 
The King of Spain, on the other hand, offered any one out of a 
dozen of Princesses, and other hopes of gain.&nbsp; But the ready
money carried the day, and Catherine came over in state to her 
merry marriage.</p>
<p>The whole Court was a great flaunting crowd of debauched men 
and shameless women; and Catherine&rsquo;s merry husband insulted
and outraged her in every possible way, until she consented to 
receive those worthless creatures as her very good friends, and 
to degrade herself by their companionship.&nbsp; A <span 
class="smcap">Mrs. Palmer</span>, whom the King made <span 
class="smcap">Lady Castlemaine</span>, and afterwards <span 
class="smcap">Duchess of Cleveland</span>, was one of the most 
powerful of the bad women about the Court, and had great 
influence with the King nearly all through his reign.&nbsp; 
Another merry lady named <span class="smcap">Moll Davies</span>, 
a dancer at the theatre, was afterwards her rival.&nbsp; So was 
<span class="smcap">Nell Gwyn</span>, first an orange girl and 
then an actress, who really had good in her, and of whom one of 
the worst things I know is, that actually she does seem to have 
been fond of the King.&nbsp; The first <span class="smcap">Duke 
of St. Albans</span> was this orange girl&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; In
like manner the son of a merry waiting-lady, whom the King 
created <span class="smcap">Duchess Of Portsmouth</span>, became 
the <span class="smcap">Duke of Richmond</span>.&nbsp; Upon the 
whole it is not so bad a thing to be a commoner.</p>
<p>The Merry Monarch was so exceedingly merry among these merry 
ladies, and some equally merry (and equally infamous) lords and 
gentlemen, that he soon got through his hundred thousand pounds, 
and then, by way of raising a little pocket-money, made a merry 
bargain.&nbsp; He sold Dunkirk to the French King for five 
millions of livres.&nbsp; When I think of the dignity to which 
Oliver Cromwell raised England in the eyes of foreign powers, and
when I think of the manner in which he gained for England this 
very Dunkirk, I am much inclined to consider that if the Merry 
Monarch had been made to follow his father for this action, he 
would have received his just deserts.</p>
<p>Though he was like his father in none of that father&rsquo;s 
greater qualities, he was like him in being worthy of no 
trust.&nbsp; When he sent that letter to the Parliament, from 
Breda, he did expressly promise that all sincere religious 
opinions should be respected.&nbsp; Yet he was no sooner firm in 
his power than he consented to one of the worst Acts of 
Parliament ever passed.&nbsp; Under this law, every minister who 
should not give his solemn assent to the Prayer-Book by a certain
day, was declared to be a minister no longer, and to be deprived 
of his church.&nbsp; The consequence of this was that some two 
thousand honest men were taken from their congregations, and 
reduced to dire poverty and distress.&nbsp; It was followed by 
another outrageous law, called the Conventicle Act, by which any 
person above the age of sixteen who was present at any religious 
service not according to the Prayer-Book, was to be imprisoned 
three months for the first offence, six for the second, and to be
transported for the third.&nbsp; This Act alone filled the 
prisons, which were then most dreadful dungeons, to 
overflowing.</p>
<p>The Covenanters in Scotland had already fared no better.&nbsp;
A base Parliament, usually known as the Drunken Parliament, in 
consequence of its principal members being seldom sober, had been
got together to make laws against the Covenanters, and to force 
all men to be of one mind in religious matters.&nbsp; The <span 
class="smcap">Marquis of Argyle</span>, relying on the 
King&rsquo;s honour, had given himself up to him; but, he was 
wealthy, and his enemies wanted his wealth.&nbsp; He was tried 
for treason, on the evidence of some private letters in which he 
had expressed opinions&mdash;as well he might&mdash;more 
favourable to the government of the late Lord Protector than of 
the present merry and religious King.&nbsp; He was executed, as 
were two men of mark among the Covenanters; and <span 
class="smcap">Sharp</span>, a traitor who had once been the 
friend of the Presbyterians and betrayed them, was made 
Archbishop of St. Andrew&rsquo;s, to teach the Scotch how to like
bishops.</p>
<p>Things being in this merry state at home, the Merry Monarch 
undertook a war with the Dutch; principally because they 
interfered with an African company, established with the two 
objects of buying gold-dust and slaves, of which the Duke of York
was a leading member.&nbsp; After some preliminary hostilities, 
the said Duke sailed to the coast of Holland with a fleet of 
ninety-eight vessels of war, and four fire-ships.&nbsp; This 
engaged with the Dutch fleet, of no fewer than one hundred and 
thirteen ships.&nbsp; In the great battle between the two forces,
the Dutch lost eighteen ships, four admirals, and seven thousand 
men.&nbsp; But, the English on shore were in no mood of 
exultation when they heard the news.</p>
<p>For, this was the year and the time of the Great Plague in 
London.&nbsp; During the winter of one thousand six hundred and 
sixty-four it had been whispered about, that some few people had 
died here and there of the disease called the Plague, in some of 
the unwholesome suburbs around London.&nbsp; News was not 
published at that time as it is now, and some people believed 
these rumours, and some disbelieved them, and they were soon 
forgotten.&nbsp; But, in the month of May, one thousand six 
hundred and sixty-five, it began to be said all over the town 
that the disease had burst out with great violence in St. 
Giles&rsquo;s, and that the people were dying in great 
numbers.&nbsp; This soon turned out to be awfully true.&nbsp; The
roads out of London were choked up by people endeavouring to 
escape from the infected city, and large sums were paid for any 
kind of conveyance.&nbsp; The disease soon spread so fast, that 
it was necessary to shut up the houses in which sick people were,
and to cut them off from communication with the living.&nbsp; 
Every one of these houses was marked on the outside of the door 
with a red cross, and the words, Lord, have mercy upon us!&nbsp; 
The streets were all deserted, grass grew in the public ways, and
there was a dreadful silence in the air.&nbsp; When night came 
on, dismal rumblings used to be heard, and these were the wheels 
of the death-carts, attended by men with veiled faces and holding
cloths to their mouths, who rang doleful bells and cried in a 
loud and solemn voice, &lsquo;Bring out your dead!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
The corpses put into these carts were buried by torchlight in 
great pits; no service being performed over them; all men being 
afraid to stay for a moment on the brink of the ghastly 
graves.&nbsp; In the general fear, children ran away from their 
parents, and parents from their children.&nbsp; Some who were 
taken ill, died alone, and without any help.&nbsp; Some were 
stabbed or strangled by hired nurses who robbed them of all their
money, and stole the very beds on which they lay.&nbsp; Some went
mad, dropped from the windows, ran through the streets, and in 
their pain and frenzy flung themselves into the river.</p>
<p>These were not all the horrors of the time.&nbsp; The wicked 
and dissolute, in wild desperation, sat in the taverns singing 
roaring songs, and were stricken as they drank, and went out and 
died.&nbsp; The fearful and superstitious persuaded themselves 
that they saw supernatural sights&mdash;burning swords in the 
sky, gigantic arms and darts.&nbsp; Others pretended that at 
nights vast crowds of ghosts walked round and round the dismal 
pits.&nbsp; One madman, naked, and carrying a brazier full of 
burning coals upon his head, stalked through the streets, crying 
out that he was a Prophet, commissioned to denounce the vengeance
of the Lord on wicked London.&nbsp; Another always went to and 
fro, exclaiming, &lsquo;Yet forty days, and London shall be 
destroyed!&rsquo;&nbsp; A third awoke the echoes in the dismal 
streets, by night and by day, and made the blood of the sick run 
cold, by calling out incessantly, in a deep hoarse voice, 
&lsquo;O, the great and dreadful God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Through the months of July and August and September, the Great
Plague raged more and more.&nbsp; Great fires were lighted in the
streets, in the hope of stopping the infection; but there was a 
plague of rain too, and it beat the fires out.&nbsp; At last, the
winds which usually arise at that time of the year which is 
called the equinox, when day and night are of equal length all 
over the world, began to blow, and to purify the wretched 
town.&nbsp; The deaths began to decrease, the red crosses slowly 
to disappear, the fugitives to return, the shops to open, pale 
frightened faces to be seen in the streets.&nbsp; The Plague had 
been in every part of England, but in close and unwholesome 
London it had killed one hundred thousand people.</p>
<p>All this time, the Merry Monarch was as merry as ever, and as 
worthless as ever.&nbsp; All this time, the debauched lords and 
gentlemen and the shameless ladies danced and gamed and drank, 
and loved and hated one another, according to their merry 
ways.</p>
<p>So little humanity did the government learn from the late 
affliction, that one of the first things the Parliament did when 
it met at Oxford (being as yet afraid to come to London), was to 
make a law, called the Five Mile Act, expressly directed against 
those poor ministers who, in the time of the Plague, had manfully
come back to comfort the unhappy people.&nbsp; This infamous law,
by forbidding them to teach in any school, or to come within five
miles of any city, town, or village, doomed them to starvation 
and death.</p>
<p>The fleet had been at sea, and healthy.&nbsp; The King of 
France was now in alliance with the Dutch, though his navy was 
chiefly employed in looking on while the English and Dutch 
fought.&nbsp; The Dutch gained one victory; and the English 
gained another and a greater; and Prince Rupert, one of the 
English admirals, was out in the Channel one windy night, looking
for the French Admiral, with the intention of giving him 
something more to do than he had had yet, when the gale increased
to a storm, and blew him into Saint Helen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That 
night was the third of September, one thousand six hundred and 
sixty-six, and that wind fanned the Great Fire of London.</p>
<p>It broke out at a baker&rsquo;s shop near London Bridge, on 
the spot on which the Monument now stands as a remembrance of 
those raging flames.&nbsp; It spread and spread, and burned and 
burned, for three days.&nbsp; The nights were lighter than the 
days; in the daytime there was an immense cloud of smoke, and in 
the night-time there was a great tower of fire mounting up into 
the sky, which lighted the whole country landscape for ten miles 
round.&nbsp; Showers of hot ashes rose into the air and fell on 
distant places; flying sparks carried the conflagration to great 
distances, and kindled it in twenty new spots at a time; church 
steeples fell down with tremendous crashes; houses crumbled into 
cinders by the hundred and the thousand.&nbsp; The summer had 
been intensely hot and dry, the streets were very narrow, and the
houses mostly built of wood and plaster.&nbsp; Nothing could stop
the tremendous fire, but the want of more houses to burn; nor did
it stop until the whole way from the Tower to Temple Bar was a 
desert, composed of the ashes of thirteen thousand houses and 
eighty-nine churches.</p>
<p>This was a terrible visitation at the time, and occasioned 
great loss and suffering to the two hundred thousand burnt-out 
people, who were obliged to lie in the fields under the open 
night sky, or in hastily-made huts of mud and straw, while the 
lanes and roads were rendered impassable by carts which had 
broken down as they tried to save their goods.&nbsp; But the Fire
was a great blessing to the City afterwards, for it arose from 
its ruins very much improved&mdash;built more regularly, more 
widely, more cleanly and carefully, and therefore much more 
healthily.&nbsp; It might be far more healthy than it is, but 
there are some people in it still&mdash;even now, at this time, 
nearly two hundred years later&mdash;so selfish, so pig-headed, 
and so ignorant, that I doubt if even another Great Fire would 
warm them up to do their duty.</p>
<p>The Catholics were accused of having wilfully set London in 
flames; one poor Frenchman, who had been mad for years, even 
accused himself of having with his own hand fired the first 
house.&nbsp; There is no reasonable doubt, however, that the fire
was accidental.&nbsp; An inscription on the Monument long 
attributed it to the Catholics; but it is removed now, and was 
always a malicious and stupid untruth.</p>
<h3>SECOND PART</h3>
<p>That the Merry Monarch might be very merry indeed, in the 
merry times when his people were suffering under pestilence and 
fire, he drank and gambled and flung away among his favourites 
the money which the Parliament had voted for the war.&nbsp; The 
consequence of this was that the stout-hearted English sailors 
were merrily starving of want, and dying in the streets; while 
the Dutch, under their admirals <span class="smcap">De 
Witt</span> and <span class="smcap">De Ruyter</span>, came into 
the River Thames, and up the River Medway as far as Upnor, burned
the guard-ships, silenced the weak batteries, and did what they 
would to the English coast for six whole weeks.&nbsp; Most of the
English ships that could have prevented them had neither powder 
nor shot on board; in this merry reign, public officers made 
themselves as merry as the King did with the public money; and 
when it was entrusted to them to spend in national defences or 
preparations, they put it into their own pockets with the 
merriest grace in the world.</p>
<p>Lord Clarendon had, by this time, run as long a course as is 
usually allotted to the unscrupulous ministers of bad 
kings.&nbsp; He was impeached by his political opponents, but 
unsuccessfully.&nbsp; The King then commanded him to withdraw 
from England and retire to France, which he did, after defending 
himself in writing.&nbsp; He was no great loss at home, and died 
abroad some seven years afterwards.</p>
<p>There then came into power a ministry called the Cabal 
Ministry, because it was composed of <span class="smcap">Lord 
Clifford</span>, the <span class="smcap">Earl of 
Arlington</span>, the <span class="smcap">Duke of 
Buckingham</span> (a great rascal, and the King&rsquo;s most 
powerful favourite), <span class="smcap">Lord Ashley</span>, and 
the <span class="smcap">Duke of Lauderdale</span>, <span 
class="smcap">c. a. b. a. l.</span>&nbsp; As the French were 
making conquests in Flanders, the first Cabal proceeding was to 
make a treaty with the Dutch, for uniting with Spain to oppose 
the French.&nbsp; It was no sooner made than the Merry Monarch, 
who always wanted to get money without being accountable to a 
Parliament for his expenditure, apologised to the King of France 
for having had anything to do with it, and concluded a secret 
treaty with him, making himself his infamous pensioner to the 
amount of two millions of livres down, and three millions more a 
year; and engaging to desert that very Spain, to make war against
those very Dutch, and to declare himself a Catholic when a 
convenient time should arrive.&nbsp; This religious king had 
lately been crying to his Catholic brother on the subject of his 
strong desire to be a Catholic; and now he merrily concluded this
treasonable conspiracy against the country he governed, by 
undertaking to become one as soon as he safely could.&nbsp; For 
all of which, though he had had ten merry heads instead of one, 
he richly deserved to lose them by the headsman&rsquo;s axe.</p>
<p>As his one merry head might have been far from safe, if these 
things had been known, they were kept very quiet, and war was 
declared by France and England against the Dutch.&nbsp; But, a 
very uncommon man, afterwards most important to English history 
and to the religion and liberty of this land, arose among them, 
and for many long years defeated the whole projects of 
France.&nbsp; This was <span class="smcap">William of 
Nassau</span>, <span class="smcap">Prince of Orange</span>, son 
of the last Prince of Orange of the same name, who married the 
daughter of Charles the First of England.&nbsp; He was a young 
man at this time, only just of age; but he was brave, cool, 
intrepid, and wise.&nbsp; His father had been so detested that, 
upon his death, the Dutch had abolished the authority to which 
this son would have otherwise succeeded (Stadtholder it was 
called), and placed the chief power in the hands of <span 
class="smcap">John de Witt</span>, who educated this young 
prince.&nbsp; Now, the Prince became very popular, and John de 
Witt&rsquo;s brother <span class="smcap">Cornelius</span> was 
sentenced to banishment on a false accusation of conspiring to 
kill him.&nbsp; John went to the prison where he was, to take him
away to exile, in his coach; and a great mob who collected on the
occasion, then and there cruelly murdered both the 
brothers.&nbsp; This left the government in the hands of the 
Prince, who was really the choice of the nation; and from this 
time he exercised it with the greatest vigour, against the whole 
power of France, under its famous generals <span 
class="smcap">Cond&eacute;</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Turenne</span>, and in support of the Protestant 
religion.&nbsp; It was full seven years before this war ended in 
a treaty of peace made at Nimeguen, and its details would occupy 
a very considerable space.&nbsp; It is enough to say that William
of Orange established a famous character with the whole world; 
and that the Merry Monarch, adding to and improving on his former
baseness, bound himself to do everything the King of France 
liked, and nothing the King of France did not like, for a pension
of one hundred thousand pounds a year, which was afterwards 
doubled.&nbsp; Besides this, the King of France, by means of his 
corrupt ambassador&mdash;who wrote accounts of his proceedings in
England, which are not always to be believed, I 
think&mdash;bought our English members of Parliament, as he 
wanted them.&nbsp; So, in point of fact, during a considerable 
portion of this merry reign, the King of France was the real King
of this country.</p>
<p>But there was a better time to come, and it was to come 
(though his royal uncle little thought so) through that very 
William, Prince of Orange.&nbsp; He came over to England, saw 
Mary, the elder daughter of the Duke of York, and married 
her.&nbsp; We shall see by-and-by what came of that marriage, and
why it is never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>This daughter was a Protestant, but her mother died a 
Catholic.&nbsp; She and her sister <span 
class="smcap">Anne</span>, also a Protestant, were the only 
survivors of eight children.&nbsp; Anne afterwards married <span 
class="smcap">George</span>, <span class="smcap">Prince of 
Denmark</span>, brother to the King of that country.</p>
<p>Lest you should do the Merry Monarch the injustice of 
supposing that he was even good humoured (except when he had 
everything his own way), or that he was high spirited and 
honourable, I will mention here what was done to a member of the 
House of Commons, <span class="smcap">Sir John 
Coventry</span>.&nbsp; He made a remark in a debate about taxing 
the theatres, which gave the King offence.&nbsp; The King agreed 
with his illegitimate son, who had been born abroad, and whom he 
had made <span class="smcap">Duke of Monmouth</span>, to take the
following merry vengeance.&nbsp; To waylay him at night, fifteen 
armed men to one, and to slit his nose with a penknife.&nbsp; 
Like master, like man.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s favourite, the Duke
of Buckingham, was strongly suspected of setting on an assassin 
to murder the <span class="smcap">Duke of Ormond</span> as he was
returning home from a dinner; and that Duke&rsquo;s spirited son,
<span class="smcap">Lord Ossory</span>, was so persuaded of his 
guilt, that he said to him at Court, even as he stood beside the 
King, &lsquo;My lord, I know very well that you are at the bottom
of this late attempt upon my father.&nbsp; But I give you 
warning, if he ever come to a violent end, his blood shall be 
upon you, and wherever I meet you I will pistol you!&nbsp; I will
do so, though I find you standing behind the King&rsquo;s chair; 
and I tell you this in his Majesty&rsquo;s presence, that you may
be quite sure of my doing what I threaten.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those 
were merry times indeed.</p>
<p>There was a fellow named <span class="smcap">Blood</span>, who
was seized for making, with two companions, an audacious attempt 
to steal the crown, the globe, and sceptre, from the place where 
the jewels were kept in the Tower.&nbsp; This robber, who was a 
swaggering ruffian, being taken, declared that he was the man who
had endeavoured to kill the Duke of Ormond, and that he had meant
to kill the King too, but was overawed by the majesty of his 
appearance, when he might otherwise have done it, as he was 
bathing at Battersea.&nbsp; The King being but an ill-looking 
fellow, I don&rsquo;t believe a word of this.&nbsp; Whether he 
was flattered, or whether he knew that Buckingham had really set 
Blood on to murder the Duke, is uncertain.&nbsp; But it is quite 
certain that he pardoned this thief, gave him an estate of five 
hundred a year in Ireland (which had had the honour of giving him
birth), and presented him at Court to the debauched lords and the
shameless ladies, who made a great deal of him&mdash;as I have no
doubt they would have made of the Devil himself, if the King had 
introduced him.</p>
<p>Infamously pensioned as he was, the King still wanted money, 
and consequently was obliged to call Parliaments.&nbsp; In these,
the great object of the Protestants was to thwart the Catholic 
Duke of York, who married a second time; his new wife being a 
young lady only fifteen years old, the Catholic sister of the 
<span class="smcap">Duke of Modena</span>.&nbsp; In this they 
were seconded by the Protestant Dissenters, though to their own 
disadvantage: since, to exclude Catholics from power, they were 
even willing to exclude themselves.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s object
was to pretend to be a Protestant, while he was really a 
Catholic; to swear to the bishops that he was devoutly attached 
to the English Church, while he knew he had bargained it away to 
the King of France; and by cheating and deceiving them, and all 
who were attached to royalty, to become despotic and be powerful 
enough to confess what a rascal he was.&nbsp; Meantime, the King 
of France, knowing his merry pensioner well, intrigued with the 
King&rsquo;s opponents in Parliament, as well as with the King 
and his friends.</p>
<p>The fears that the country had of the Catholic religion being 
restored, if the Duke of York should come to the throne, and the 
low cunning of the King in pretending to share their alarms, led 
to some very terrible results.&nbsp; A certain <span 
class="smcap">Dr. Tonge</span>, a dull clergyman in the City, 
fell into the hands of a certain <span class="smcap">Titus 
Oates</span>, a most infamous character, who pretended to have 
acquired among the Jesuits abroad a knowledge of a great plot for
the murder of the King, and the re-establishment if the Catholic 
religion.&nbsp; Titus Oates, being produced by this unlucky Dr. 
Tonge and solemnly examined before the council, contradicted 
himself in a thousand ways, told the most ridiculous and 
improbable stories, and implicated <span 
class="smcap">Coleman</span>, the Secretary of the Duchess of 
York.&nbsp; Now, although what he charged against Coleman was not
true, and although you and I know very well that the real 
dangerous Catholic plot was that one with the King of France of 
which the Merry Monarch was himself the head, there happened to 
be found among Coleman&rsquo;s papers, some letters, in which he 
did praise the days of Bloody Queen Mary, and abuse the 
Protestant religion.&nbsp; This was great good fortune for Titus,
as it seemed to confirm him; but better still was in store.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Sir Edmundbury Godfrey</span>, the magistrate
who had first examined him, being unexpectedly found dead near 
Primrose Hill, was confidently believed to have been killed by 
the Catholics.&nbsp; I think there is no doubt that he had been 
melancholy mad, and that he killed himself; but he had a great 
Protestant funeral, and Titus was called the Saver of the Nation,
and received a pension of twelve hundred pounds a year.</p>
<p>As soon as Oates&rsquo;s wickedness had met with this success,
up started another villain, named <span class="smcap">William 
Bedloe</span>, who, attracted by a reward of five hundred pounds 
offered for the apprehension of the murderers of Godfrey, came 
forward and charged two Jesuits and some other persons with 
having committed it at the Queen&rsquo;s desire.&nbsp; Oates, 
going into partnership with this new informer, had the audacity 
to accuse the poor Queen herself of high treason.&nbsp; Then 
appeared a third informer, as bad as either of the two, and 
accused a Catholic banker named <span 
class="smcap">Stayley</span> of having said that the King was the
greatest rogue in the world (which would not have been far from 
the truth), and that he would kill him with his own hand.&nbsp; 
This banker, being at once tried and executed, Coleman and two 
others were tried and executed.&nbsp; Then, a miserable wretch 
named <span class="smcap">Prance</span>, a Catholic silversmith, 
being accused by Bedloe, was tortured into confessing that he had
taken part in Godfrey&rsquo;s murder, and into accusing three 
other men of having committed it.&nbsp; Then, five Jesuits were 
accused by Oates, Bedloe, and Prance together, and were all found
guilty, and executed on the same kind of contradictory and absurd
evidence.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s physician and three monks were 
next put on their trial; but Oates and Bedloe had for the time 
gone far enough and these four were acquitted.&nbsp; The public 
mind, however, was so full of a Catholic plot, and so strong 
against the Duke of York, that James consented to obey a written 
order from his brother, and to go with his family to Brussels, 
provided that his rights should never be sacrificed in his 
absence to the Duke of Monmouth.&nbsp; The House of Commons, not 
satisfied with this as the King hoped, passed a bill to exclude 
the Duke from ever succeeding to the throne.&nbsp; In return, the
King dissolved the Parliament.&nbsp; He had deserted his old 
favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, who was now in the 
opposition.</p>
<p>To give any sufficient idea of the miseries of Scotland in 
this merry reign, would occupy a hundred pages.&nbsp; Because the
people would not have bishops, and were resolved to stand by 
their solemn League and Covenant, such cruelties were inflicted 
upon them as make the blood run cold.&nbsp; Ferocious dragoons 
galloped through the country to punish the peasants for deserting
the churches; sons were hanged up at their fathers&rsquo; doors 
for refusing to disclose where their fathers were concealed; 
wives were tortured to death for not betraying their husbands; 
people were taken out of their fields and gardens, and shot on 
the public roads without trial; lighted matches were tied to the 
fingers of prisoners, and a most horrible torment called the Boot
was invented, and constantly applied, which ground and mashed the
victims&rsquo; legs with iron wedges.&nbsp; Witnesses were 
tortured as well as prisoners.&nbsp; All the prisons were full; 
all the gibbets were heavy with bodies; murder and plunder 
devastated the whole country.&nbsp; In spite of all, the 
Covenanters were by no means to be dragged into the churches, and
persisted in worshipping God as they thought right.&nbsp; A body 
of ferocious Highlanders, turned upon them from the mountains of 
their own country, had no greater effect than the English 
dragoons under <span class="smcap">Grahame of Claverhouse</span>,
the most cruel and rapacious of all their enemies, whose name 
will ever be cursed through the length and breadth of 
Scotland.&nbsp; Archbishop Sharp had ever aided and abetted all 
these outrages.&nbsp; But he fell at last; for, when the injuries
of the Scottish people were at their height, he was seen, in his 
coach-and-six coming across a moor, by a body of men, headed by 
one <span class="smcap">John Balfour</span>, who were waiting for
another of their oppressors.&nbsp; Upon this they cried out that 
Heaven had delivered him into their hands, and killed him with 
many wounds.&nbsp; If ever a man deserved such a death, I think 
Archbishop Sharp did.</p>
<p>It made a great noise directly, and the Merry 
Monarch&mdash;strongly suspected of having goaded the Scottish 
people on, that he might have an excuse for a greater army than 
the Parliament were willing to give him&mdash;sent down his son, 
the Duke of Monmouth, as commander-in-chief, with instructions to
attack the Scottish rebels, or Whigs as they were called, 
whenever he came up with them.&nbsp; Marching with ten thousand 
men from Edinburgh, he found them, in number four or five 
thousand, drawn up at Bothwell Bridge, by the Clyde.&nbsp; They 
were soon dispersed; and Monmouth showed a more humane character 
towards them, than he had shown towards that Member of Parliament
whose nose he had caused to be slit with a penknife.&nbsp; But 
the Duke of Lauderdale was their bitter foe, and sent Claverhouse
to finish them.</p>
<p>As the Duke of York became more and more unpopular, the Duke 
of Monmouth became more and more popular.&nbsp; It would have 
been decent in the latter not to have voted in favour of the 
renewed bill for the exclusion of James from the throne; but he 
did so, much to the King&rsquo;s amusement, who used to sit in 
the House of Lords by the fire, hearing the debates, which he 
said were as good as a play.&nbsp; The House of Commons passed 
the bill by a large majority, and it was carried up to the House 
of Lords by <span class="smcap">Lord Russell</span>, one of the 
best of the leaders on the Protestant side.&nbsp; It was rejected
there, chiefly because the bishops helped the King to get rid of 
it; and the fear of Catholic plots revived again.&nbsp; There had
been another got up, by a fellow out of Newgate, named <span 
class="smcap">Dangerfield</span>, which is more famous than it 
deserves to be, under the name of the <span 
class="smcap">Meal-Tub Plot</span>.&nbsp; This jail-bird having 
been got out of Newgate by a <span class="smcap">Mrs. 
Cellier</span>, a Catholic nurse, had turned Catholic himself, 
and pretended that he knew of a plot among the Presbyterians 
against the King&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; This was very pleasant to 
the Duke of York, who hated the Presbyterians, who returned the 
compliment.&nbsp; He gave Dangerfield twenty guineas, and sent 
him to the King his brother.&nbsp; But Dangerfield, breaking down
altogether in his charge, and being sent back to Newgate, almost 
astonished the Duke out of his five senses by suddenly swearing 
that the Catholic nurse had put that false design into his head, 
and that what he really knew about, was, a Catholic plot against 
the King; the evidence of which would be found in some papers, 
concealed in a meal-tub in Mrs. Cellier&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; 
There they were, of course&mdash;for he had put them there 
himself&mdash;and so the tub gave the name to the plot.&nbsp; 
But, the nurse was acquitted on her trial, and it came to 
nothing.</p>
<p>Lord Ashley, of the Cabal, was now Lord Shaftesbury, and was 
strong against the succession of the Duke of York.&nbsp; The 
House of Commons, aggravated to the utmost extent, as we may well
suppose, by suspicions of the King&rsquo;s conspiracy with the 
King of France, made a desperate point of the exclusion, still, 
and were bitter against the Catholics generally.&nbsp; So 
unjustly bitter were they, I grieve to say, that they impeached 
the venerable Lord Stafford, a Catholic nobleman seventy years 
old, of a design to kill the King.&nbsp; The witnesses were that 
atrocious Oates and two other birds of the same feather.&nbsp; He
was found guilty, on evidence quite as foolish as it was false, 
and was beheaded on Tower Hill.&nbsp; The people were opposed to 
him when he first appeared upon the scaffold; but, when he had 
addressed them and shown them how innocent he was and how 
wickedly he was sent there, their better nature was aroused, and 
they said, &lsquo;We believe you, my Lord.&nbsp; God bless you, 
my Lord!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The House of Commons refused to let the King have any money 
until he should consent to the Exclusion Bill; but, as he could 
get it and did get it from his master the King of France, he 
could afford to hold them very cheap.&nbsp; He called a 
Parliament at Oxford, to which he went down with a great show of 
being armed and protected as if he were in danger of his life, 
and to which the opposition members also went armed and 
protected, alleging that they were in fear of the Papists, who 
were numerous among the King&rsquo;s guards.&nbsp; However, they 
went on with the Exclusion Bill, and were so earnest upon it that
they would have carried it again, if the King had not popped his 
crown and state robes into a sedan-chair, bundled himself into it
along with them, hurried down to the chamber where the House of 
Lords met, and dissolved the Parliament.&nbsp; After which he 
scampered home, and the members of Parliament scampered home too,
as fast as their legs could carry them.</p>
<p>The Duke of York, then residing in Scotland, had, under the 
law which excluded Catholics from public trust, no right whatever
to public employment.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he was openly employed 
as the King&rsquo;s representative in Scotland, and there 
gratified his sullen and cruel nature to his heart&rsquo;s 
content by directing the dreadful cruelties against the 
Covenanters.&nbsp; There were two ministers named <span 
class="smcap">Cargill</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Cameron</span> who had escaped from the battle of 
Bothwell Bridge, and who returned to Scotland, and raised the 
miserable but still brave and unsubdued Covenanters afresh, under
the name of Cameronians.&nbsp; As Cameron publicly posted a 
declaration that the King was a forsworn tyrant, no mercy was 
shown to his unhappy followers after he was slain in 
battle.&nbsp; The Duke of York, who was particularly fond of the 
Boot and derived great pleasure from having it applied, offered 
their lives to some of these people, if they would cry on the 
scaffold &lsquo;God save the King!&rsquo;&nbsp; But their 
relations, friends, and countrymen, had been so barbarously 
tortured and murdered in this merry reign, that they preferred to
die, and did die.&nbsp; The Duke then obtained his merry 
brother&rsquo;s permission to hold a Parliament in Scotland, 
which first, with most shameless deceit, confirmed the laws for 
securing the Protestant religion against Popery, and then 
declared that nothing must or should prevent the succession of 
the Popish Duke.&nbsp; After this double-faced beginning, it 
established an oath which no human being could understand, but 
which everybody was to take, as a proof that his religion was the
lawful religion.&nbsp; The Earl of Argyle, taking it with the 
explanation that he did not consider it to prevent him from 
favouring any alteration either in the Church or State which was 
not inconsistent with the Protestant religion or with his 
loyalty, was tried for high treason before a Scottish jury of 
which the <span class="smcap">Marquis of Montrose</span> was 
foreman, and was found guilty.&nbsp; He escaped the scaffold, for
that time, by getting away, in the disguise of a page, in the 
train of his daughter, <span class="smcap">Lady Sophia 
Lindsay</span>.&nbsp; It was absolutely proposed, by certain 
members of the Scottish Council, that this lady should be whipped
through the streets of Edinburgh.&nbsp; But this was too much 
even for the Duke, who had the manliness then (he had very little
at most times) to remark that Englishmen were not accustomed to 
treat ladies in that manner.&nbsp; In those merry times nothing 
could equal the brutal servility of the Scottish fawners, but the
conduct of similar degraded beings in England.</p>
<p>After the settlement of these little affairs, the Duke 
returned to England, and soon resumed his place at the Council, 
and his office of High Admiral&mdash;all this by his 
brother&rsquo;s favour, and in open defiance of the law.&nbsp; It
would have been no loss to the country, if he had been drowned 
when his ship, in going to Scotland to fetch his family, struck 
on a sand-bank, and was lost with two hundred souls on 
board.&nbsp; But he escaped in a boat with some friends; and the 
sailors were so brave and unselfish, that, when they saw him 
rowing away, they gave three cheers, while they themselves were 
going down for ever.</p>
<p>The Merry Monarch, having got rid of his Parliament, went to 
work to make himself despotic, with all speed.&nbsp; Having had 
the villainy to order the execution of <span class="smcap">Oliver
Plunket</span>, <span class="smcap">Bishop of Armagh</span>, 
falsely accused of a plot to establish Popery in that country by 
means of a French army&mdash;the very thing this royal traitor 
was himself trying to do at home&mdash;and having tried to ruin 
Lord Shaftesbury, and failed&mdash;he turned his hand to 
controlling the corporations all over the country; because, if he
could only do that, he could get what juries he chose, to bring 
in perjured verdicts, and could get what members he chose 
returned to Parliament.&nbsp; These merry times produced, and 
made Chief Justice of the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, a drunken 
ruffian of the name of <span class="smcap">Jeffreys</span>; a 
red-faced, swollen, bloated, horrible creature, with a bullying, 
roaring voice, and a more savage nature perhaps than was ever 
lodged in any human breast.&nbsp; This monster was the Merry 
Monarch&rsquo;s especial favourite, and he testified his 
admiration of him by giving him a ring from his own finger, which
the people used to call Judge Jeffreys&rsquo;s Bloodstone.&nbsp; 
Him the King employed to go about and bully the corporations, 
beginning with London; or, as Jeffreys himself elegantly called 
it, &lsquo;to give them a lick with the rough side of his 
tongue.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he did it so thoroughly, that they soon 
became the basest and most sycophantic bodies in the 
kingdom&mdash;except the University of Oxford, which, in that 
respect, was quite pre-eminent and unapproachable.</p>
<p>Lord Shaftesbury (who died soon after the King&rsquo;s failure
against him), <span class="smcap">Lord William Russell</span>, 
the Duke of Monmouth, <span class="smcap">Lord Howard</span>, 
<span class="smcap">Lord Jersey</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Algernon Sidney</span>, <span class="smcap">John 
Hampden</span> (grandson of the great Hampden), and some others, 
used to hold a council together after the dissolution of the 
Parliament, arranging what it might be necessary to do, if the 
King carried his Popish plot to the utmost height.&nbsp; Lord 
Shaftesbury having been much the most violent of this party, 
brought two violent men into their secrets&mdash;<span 
class="smcap">Rumsey</span>, who had been a soldier in the 
Republican army; and <span class="smcap">West</span>, a 
lawyer.&nbsp; These two knew an old officer of <span 
class="smcap">Cromwell&rsquo;s</span>, called <span 
class="smcap">Rumbold</span>, who had married a maltster&rsquo;s 
widow, and so had come into possession of a solitary dwelling 
called the Rye House, near Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; 
Rumbold said to them what a capital place this house of his would
be from which to shoot at the King, who often passed there going 
to and fro from Newmarket.&nbsp; They liked the idea, and 
entertained it.&nbsp; But, one of their body gave information; 
and they, together with <span class="smcap">Shepherd</span> a 
wine merchant, Lord Russell, Algernon Sidney, <span 
class="smcap">Lord Essex</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord 
Howard</span>, and Hampden, were all arrested.</p>
<p>Lord Russell might have easily escaped, but scorned to do so, 
being innocent of any wrong; Lord Essex might have easily 
escaped, but scorned to do so, lest his flight should prejudice 
Lord Russell.&nbsp; But it weighed upon his mind that he had 
brought into their council, Lord Howard&mdash;who now turned a 
miserable traitor&mdash;against a great dislike Lord Russell had 
always had of him.&nbsp; He could not bear the reflection, and 
destroyed himself before Lord Russell was brought to trial at the
Old Bailey.</p>
<p>He knew very well that he had nothing to hope, having always 
been manful in the Protestant cause against the two false 
brothers, the one on the throne, and the other standing next to 
it.&nbsp; He had a wife, one of the noblest and best of women, 
who acted as his secretary on his trial, who comforted him in his
prison, who supped with him on the night before he died, and 
whose love and virtue and devotion have made her name 
imperishable.&nbsp; Of course, he was found guilty, and was 
sentenced to be beheaded in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn-fields, not many 
yards from his own house.&nbsp; When he had parted from his 
children on the evening before his death, his wife still stayed 
with him until ten o&rsquo;clock at night; and when their final 
separation in this world was over, and he had kissed her many 
times, he still sat for a long while in his prison, talking of 
her goodness.&nbsp; Hearing the rain fall fast at that time, he 
calmly said, &lsquo;Such a rain to-morrow will spoil a great 
show, which is a dull thing on a rainy day.&rsquo;&nbsp; At 
midnight he went to bed, and slept till four; even when his 
servant called him, he fell asleep again while his clothes were 
being made ready.&nbsp; He rode to the scaffold in his own 
carriage, attended by two famous clergymen, <span 
class="smcap">Tillotson</span> and <span 
class="smcap">Burnet</span>, and sang a psalm to himself very 
softly, as he went along.&nbsp; He was as quiet and as steady as 
if he had been going out for an ordinary ride.&nbsp; After saying
that he was surprised to see so great a crowd, he laid down his 
head upon the block, as if upon the pillow of his bed, and had it
struck off at the second blow.&nbsp; His noble wife was busy for 
him even then; for that true-hearted lady printed and widely 
circulated his last words, of which he had given her a 
copy.&nbsp; They made the blood of all the honest men in England 
boil.</p>
<p>The University of Oxford distinguished itself on the very same
day by pretending to believe that the accusation against Lord 
Russell was true, and by calling the King, in a written paper, 
the Breath of their Nostrils and the Anointed of the Lord.&nbsp; 
This paper the Parliament afterwards caused to be burned by the 
common hangman; which I am sorry for, as I wish it had been 
framed and glazed and hung up in some public place, as a monument
of baseness for the scorn of mankind.</p>
<p>Next, came the trial of Algernon Sidney, at which Jeffreys 
presided, like a great crimson toad, sweltering and swelling with
rage.&nbsp; &lsquo;I pray God, Mr. Sidney,&rsquo; said this Chief
Justice of a merry reign, after passing sentence, &lsquo;to work 
in you a temper fit to go to the other world, for I see you are 
not fit for this.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; said the 
prisoner, composedly holding out his arm, &lsquo;feel my pulse, 
and see if I be disordered.&nbsp; I thank Heaven I never was in 
better temper than I am now.&rsquo;&nbsp; Algernon Sidney was 
executed on Tower Hill, on the seventh of December, one thousand 
six hundred and eighty-three.&nbsp; He died a hero, and died, in 
his own words, &lsquo;For that good old cause in which he had 
been engaged from his youth, and for which God had so often and 
so wonderfully declared himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Duke of Monmouth had been making his uncle, the Duke of 
York, very jealous, by going about the country in a royal sort of
way, playing at the people&rsquo;s games, becoming godfather to 
their children, and even touching for the King&rsquo;s evil, or 
stroking the faces of the sick to cure them&mdash;though, for the
matter of that, I should say he did them about as much good as 
any crowned king could have done.&nbsp; His father had got him to
write a letter, confessing his having had a part in the 
conspiracy, for which Lord Russell had been beheaded; but he was 
ever a weak man, and as soon as he had written it, he was ashamed
of it and got it back again.&nbsp; For this, he was banished to 
the Netherlands; but he soon returned and had an interview with 
his father, unknown to his uncle.&nbsp; It would seem that he was
coming into the Merry Monarch&rsquo;s favour again, and that the 
Duke of York was sliding out of it, when Death appeared to the 
merry galleries at Whitehall, and astonished the debauched lords 
and gentlemen, and the shameless ladies, very considerably.</p>
<p>On Monday, the second of February, one thousand six hundred 
and eighty-five, the merry pensioner and servant of the King of 
France fell down in a fit of apoplexy.&nbsp; By the Wednesday his
case was hopeless, and on the Thursday he was told so.&nbsp; As 
he made a difficulty about taking the sacrament from the 
Protestant Bishop of Bath, the Duke of York got all who were 
present away from the bed, and asked his brother, in a whisper, 
if he should send for a Catholic priest?&nbsp;&nbsp; The King 
replied, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, brother, do!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
The Duke smuggled in, up the back stairs, disguised in a wig and 
gown, a priest named <span class="smcap">Huddleston</span>, who 
had saved the King&rsquo;s life after the battle of Worcester: 
telling him that this worthy man in the wig had once saved his 
body, and was now come to save his soul.</p>
<p>The Merry Monarch lived through that night, and died before 
noon on the next day, which was Friday, the sixth.&nbsp; Two of 
the last things he said were of a human sort, and your 
remembrance will give him the full benefit of them.&nbsp; When 
the Queen sent to say she was too unwell to attend him and to ask
his pardon, he said, &lsquo;Alas! poor woman, <i>she</i> beg 
<i>my</i> pardon!&nbsp; I beg hers with all my heart.&nbsp; Take 
back that answer to her.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he also said, in 
reference to Nell Gwyn, &lsquo;Do not let poor Nelly 
starve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He died in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the 
twenty-fifth of his reign.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI&mdash;ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE SECOND</h2>
<p>King James the Second was a man so very disagreeable, that 
even the best of historians has favoured his brother Charles, as 
becoming, by comparison, quite a pleasant character.&nbsp; The 
one object of his short reign was to re-establish the Catholic 
religion in England; and this he doggedly pursued with such a 
stupid obstinacy, that his career very soon came to a close.</p>
<p>The first thing he did, was, to assure his council that he 
would make it his endeavour to preserve the Government, both in 
Church and State, as it was by law established; and that he would
always take care to defend and support the Church.&nbsp; Great 
public acclamations were raised over this fair speech, and a 
great deal was said, from the pulpits and elsewhere, about the 
word of a King which was never broken, by credulous people who 
little supposed that he had formed a secret council for Catholic 
affairs, of which a mischievous Jesuit, called <span 
class="smcap">Father Petre</span>, was one of the chief 
members.&nbsp; With tears of joy in his eyes, he received, as the
beginning of <i>his</i> pension from the King of France, five 
hundred thousand livres; yet, with a mixture of meanness and 
arrogance that belonged to his contemptible character, he was 
always jealous of making some show of being independent of the 
King of France, while he pocketed his money.&nbsp; 
As&mdash;notwithstanding his publishing two papers in favour of 
Popery (and not likely to do it much service, I should think) 
written by the King, his brother, and found in his strong-box; 
and his open display of himself attending mass&mdash;the 
Parliament was very obsequious, and granted him a large sum of 
money, he began his reign with a belief that he could do what he 
pleased, and with a determination to do it.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to its principal events, let us dispose of 
Titus Oates.&nbsp; He was tried for perjury, a fortnight after 
the coronation, and besides being very heavily fined, was 
sentenced to stand twice in the pillory, to be whipped from 
Aldgate to Newgate one day, and from Newgate to Tyburn two days 
afterwards, and to stand in the pillory five times a year as long
as he lived.&nbsp; This fearful sentence was actually inflicted 
on the rascal.&nbsp; Being unable to stand after his first 
flogging, he was dragged on a sledge from Newgate to Tyburn, and 
flogged as he was drawn along.&nbsp; He was so strong a villain 
that he did not die under the torture, but lived to be afterwards
pardoned and rewarded, though not to be ever believed in any 
more.&nbsp; Dangerfield, the only other one of that crew left 
alive, was not so fortunate.&nbsp; He was almost killed by a 
whipping from Newgate to Tyburn, and, as if that were not 
punishment enough, a ferocious barrister of Gray&rsquo;s Inn gave
him a poke in the eye with his cane, which caused his death; for 
which the ferocious barrister was deservedly tried and 
executed.</p>
<p>As soon as James was on the throne, Argyle and Monmouth went 
from Brussels to Rotterdam, and attended a meeting of Scottish 
exiles held there, to concert measures for a rising in 
England.&nbsp; It was agreed that Argyle should effect a landing 
in Scotland, and Monmouth in England; and that two Englishmen 
should be sent with Argyle to be in his confidence, and two 
Scotchmen with the Duke of Monmouth.</p>
<p>Argyle was the first to act upon this contract.&nbsp; But, two
of his men being taken prisoners at the Orkney Islands, the 
Government became aware of his intention, and was able to act 
against him with such vigour as to prevent his raising more than 
two or three thousand Highlanders, although he sent a fiery 
cross, by trusty messengers, from clan to clan and from glen to 
glen, as the custom then was when those wild people were to be 
excited by their chiefs.&nbsp; As he was moving towards Glasgow 
with his small force, he was betrayed by some of his followers, 
taken, and carried, with his hands tied behind his back, to his 
old prison in Edinburgh Castle.&nbsp; James ordered him to be 
executed, on his old shamefully unjust sentence, within three 
days; and he appears to have been anxious that his legs should 
have been pounded with his old favourite the boot.&nbsp; However,
the boot was not applied; he was simply beheaded, and his head 
was set upon the top of Edinburgh Jail.&nbsp; One of those 
Englishmen who had been assigned to him was that old soldier 
Rumbold, the master of the Rye House.&nbsp; He was sorely 
wounded, and within a week after Argyle had suffered with great 
courage, was brought up for trial, lest he should die and 
disappoint the King.&nbsp; He, too, was executed, after defending
himself with great spirit, and saying that he did not believe 
that God had made the greater part of mankind to carry saddles on
their backs and bridles in their mouths, and to be ridden by a 
few, booted and spurred for the purpose&mdash;in which I 
thoroughly agree with Rumbold.</p>
<p>The Duke of Monmouth, partly through being detained and partly
through idling his time away, was five or six weeks behind his 
friend when he landed at Lyme, in Dorset: having at his right 
hand an unlucky nobleman called <span class="smcap">Lord Grey of 
Werk</span>, who of himself would have ruined a far more 
promising expedition.&nbsp; He immediately set up his standard in
the market-place, and proclaimed the King a tyrant, and a Popish 
usurper, and I know not what else; charging him, not only with 
what he had done, which was bad enough, but with what neither he 
nor anybody else had done, such as setting fire to London, and 
poisoning the late King.&nbsp; Raising some four thousand men by 
these means, he marched on to Taunton, where there were many 
Protestant dissenters who were strongly opposed to the 
Catholics.&nbsp; Here, both the rich and poor turned out to 
receive him, ladies waved a welcome to him from all the windows 
as he passed along the streets, flowers were strewn in his way, 
and every compliment and honour that could be devised was 
showered upon him.&nbsp; Among the rest, twenty young ladies came
forward, in their best clothes, and in their brightest beauty, 
and gave him a Bible ornamented with their own fair hands, 
together with other presents.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this homage, he proclaimed himself King, and 
went on to Bridgewater.&nbsp; But, here the Government troops, 
under the <span class="smcap">Earl of Feversham</span>, were 
close at hand; and he was so dispirited at finding that he made 
but few powerful friends after all, that it was a question 
whether he should disband his army and endeavour to escape.&nbsp;
It was resolved, at the instance of that unlucky Lord Grey, to 
make a night attack on the King&rsquo;s army, as it lay encamped 
on the edge of a morass called Sedgemoor.&nbsp; The horsemen were
commanded by the same unlucky lord, who was not a brave 
man.&nbsp; He gave up the battle almost at the first 
obstacle&mdash;which was a deep drain; and although the poor 
countrymen, who had turned out for Monmouth, fought bravely with 
scythes, poles, pitchforks, and such poor weapons as they had, 
they were soon dispersed by the trained soldiers, and fled in all
directions.&nbsp; When the Duke of Monmouth himself fled, was not
known in the confusion; but the unlucky Lord Grey was taken early
next day, and then another of the party was taken, who confessed 
that he had parted from the Duke only four hours before.&nbsp; 
Strict search being made, he was found disguised as a peasant, 
hidden in a ditch under fern and nettles, with a few peas in his 
pocket which he had gathered in the fields to eat.&nbsp; The only
other articles he had upon him were a few papers and little 
books: one of the latter being a strange jumble, in his own 
writing, of charms, songs, recipes, and prayers.&nbsp; He was 
completely broken.&nbsp; He wrote a miserable letter to the King,
beseeching and entreating to be allowed to see him.&nbsp; When he
was taken to London, and conveyed bound into the King&rsquo;s 
presence, he crawled to him on his knees, and made a most 
degrading exhibition.&nbsp; As James never forgave or relented 
towards anybody, he was not likely to soften towards the issuer 
of the Lyme proclamation, so he told the suppliant to prepare for
death.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of July, one thousand six hundred and 
eighty-five, this unfortunate favourite of the people was brought
out to die on Tower Hill.&nbsp; The crowd was immense, and the 
tops of all the houses were covered with gazers.&nbsp; He had 
seen his wife, the daughter of the Duke of Buccleuch, in the 
Tower, and had talked much of a lady whom he loved far 
better&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Lady Harriet 
Wentworth</span>&mdash;who was one of the last persons he 
remembered in this life.&nbsp; Before laying down his head upon 
the block he felt the edge of the axe, and told the executioner 
that he feared it was not sharp enough, and that the axe was not 
heavy enough.&nbsp; On the executioner replying that it was of 
the proper kind, the Duke said, &lsquo;I pray you have a care, 
and do not use me so awkwardly as you used my Lord 
Russell.&rsquo;&nbsp; The executioner, made nervous by this, and 
trembling, struck once and merely gashed him in the neck.&nbsp; 
Upon this, the Duke of Monmouth raised his head and looked the 
man reproachfully in the face.&nbsp; Then he struck twice, and 
then thrice, and then threw down the axe, and cried out in a 
voice of horror that he could not finish that work.&nbsp; The 
sheriffs, however, threatening him with what should be done to 
himself if he did not, he took it up again and struck a fourth 
time and a fifth time.&nbsp; Then the wretched head at last fell 
off, and James, Duke of Monmouth, was dead, in the thirty-sixth 
year of his age.&nbsp; He was a showy, graceful man, with many 
popular qualities, and had found much favour in the open hearts 
of the English.</p>
<p>The atrocities, committed by the Government, which followed 
this Monmouth rebellion, form the blackest and most lamentable 
page in English history.&nbsp; The poor peasants, having been 
dispersed with great loss, and their leaders having been taken, 
one would think that the implacable King might have been 
satisfied.&nbsp; But no; he let loose upon them, among other 
intolerable monsters, a <span class="smcap">Colonel Kirk</span>, 
who had served against the Moors, and whose soldiers&mdash;called
by the people Kirk&rsquo;s lambs, because they bore a lamb upon 
their flag, as the emblem of Christianity&mdash;were worthy of 
their leader.&nbsp; The atrocities committed by these demons in 
human shape are far too horrible to be related here.&nbsp; It is 
enough to say, that besides most ruthlessly murdering and robbing
them, and ruining them by making them buy their pardons at the 
price of all they possessed, it was one of Kirk&rsquo;s favourite
amusements, as he and his officers sat drinking after dinner, and
toasting the King, to have batches of prisoners hanged outside 
the windows for the company&rsquo;s diversion; and that when 
their feet quivered in the convulsions of death, he used to swear
that they should have music to their dancing, and would order the
drums to beat and the trumpets to play.&nbsp; The detestable King
informed him, as an acknowledgment of these services, that he was
&lsquo;very well satisfied with his proceedings.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
the King&rsquo;s great delight was in the proceedings of 
Jeffreys, now a peer, who went down into the west, with four 
other judges, to try persons accused of having had any share in 
the rebellion.&nbsp; The King pleasantly called this 
&lsquo;Jeffreys&rsquo;s campaign.&rsquo;&nbsp; The people down in
that part of the country remember it to this day as The Bloody 
Assize.</p>
<p>It began at Winchester, where a poor deaf old lady, <span 
class="smcap">Mrs. Alicia Lisle</span>, the widow of one of the 
judges of Charles the First (who had been murdered abroad by some
Royalist assassins), was charged with having given shelter in her
house to two fugitives from Sedgemoor.&nbsp; Three times the jury
refused to find her guilty, until Jeffreys bullied and frightened
them into that false verdict.&nbsp; When he had extorted it from 
them, he said, &lsquo;Gentlemen, if I had been one of you, and 
she had been my own mother, I would have found her 
guilty;&rsquo;&mdash;as I dare say he would.&nbsp; He sentenced 
her to be burned alive, that very afternoon.&nbsp; The clergy of 
the cathedral and some others interfered in her favour, and she 
was beheaded within a week.&nbsp; As a high mark of his 
approbation, the King made Jeffreys Lord Chancellor; and he then 
went on to Dorchester, to Exeter, to Taunton, and to Wells.&nbsp;
It is astonishing, when we read of the enormous injustice and 
barbarity of this beast, to know that no one struck him dead on 
the judgment-seat.&nbsp; It was enough for any man or woman to be
accused by an enemy, before Jeffreys, to be found guilty of high 
treason.&nbsp; One man who pleaded not guilty, he ordered to be 
taken out of court upon the instant, and hanged; and this so 
terrified the prisoners in general that they mostly pleaded 
guilty at once.&nbsp; At Dorchester alone, in the course of a few
days, Jeffreys hanged eighty people; besides whipping, 
transporting, imprisoning, and selling as slaves, great 
numbers.&nbsp; He executed, in all, two hundred and fifty, or 
three hundred.</p>
<p>These executions took place, among the neighbours and friends 
of the sentenced, in thirty-six towns and villages.&nbsp; Their 
bodies were mangled, steeped in caldrons of boiling pitch and 
tar, and hung up by the roadsides, in the streets, over the very 
churches.&nbsp; The sight and smell of heads and limbs, the 
hissing and bubbling of the infernal caldrons, and the tears and 
terrors of the people, were dreadful beyond all 
description.&nbsp; One rustic, who was forced to steep the 
remains in the black pot, was ever afterwards called &lsquo;Tom 
Boilman.&rsquo;&nbsp; The hangman has ever since been called Jack
Ketch, because a man of that name went hanging and hanging, all 
day long, in the train of Jeffreys.&nbsp; You will hear much of 
the horrors of the great French Revolution.&nbsp; Many and 
terrible they were, there is no doubt; but I know of nothing 
worse, done by the maddened people of France in that awful time, 
than was done by the highest judge in England, with the express 
approval of the King of England, in The Bloody Assize.</p>
<p>Nor was even this all.&nbsp; Jeffreys was as fond of money for
himself as of misery for others, and he sold pardons wholesale to
fill his pockets.&nbsp; The King ordered, at one time, a thousand
prisoners to be given to certain of his favourites, in order that
they might bargain with them for their pardons.&nbsp; The young 
ladies of Taunton who had presented the Bible, were bestowed upon
the maids of honour at court; and those precious ladies made very
hard bargains with them indeed.&nbsp; When The Bloody Assize was 
at its most dismal height, the King was diverting himself with 
horse-races in the very place where Mrs. Lisle had been 
executed.&nbsp; When Jeffreys had done his worst, and came home 
again, he was particularly complimented in the Royal Gazette; and
when the King heard that through drunkenness and raging he was 
very ill, his odious Majesty remarked that such another man could
not easily be found in England.&nbsp; Besides all this, a former 
sheriff of London, named <span class="smcap">Cornish</span>, was 
hanged within sight of his own house, after an abominably 
conducted trial, for having had a share in the Rye House Plot, on
evidence given by Rumsey, which that villain was obliged to 
confess was directly opposed to the evidence he had given on the 
trial of Lord Russell.&nbsp; And on the very same day, a worthy 
widow, named <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Gaunt</span>, was 
burned alive at Tyburn, for having sheltered a wretch who himself
gave evidence against her.&nbsp; She settled the fuel about 
herself with her own hands, so that the flames should reach her 
quickly: and nobly said, with her last breath, that she had 
obeyed the sacred command of God, to give refuge to the outcast, 
and not to betray the wanderer.</p>
<p>After all this hanging, beheading, burning, boiling, 
mutilating, exposing, robbing, transporting, and selling into 
slavery, of his unhappy subjects, the King not unnaturally 
thought that he could do whatever he would.&nbsp; So, he went to 
work to change the religion of the country with all possible 
speed; and what he did was this.</p>
<p>He first of all tried to get rid of what was called the Test 
Act&mdash;which prevented the Catholics from holding public 
employments&mdash;by his own power of dispensing with the 
penalties.&nbsp; He tried it in one case, and, eleven of the 
twelve judges deciding in his favour, he exercised it in three 
others, being those of three dignitaries of University College, 
Oxford, who had become Papists, and whom he kept in their places 
and sanctioned.&nbsp; He revived the hated Ecclesiastical 
Commission, to get rid of <span class="smcap">Compton</span>, 
Bishop of London, who manfully opposed him.&nbsp; He solicited 
the Pope to favour England with an ambassador, which the Pope 
(who was a sensible man then) rather unwillingly did.&nbsp; He 
flourished Father Petre before the eyes of the people on all 
possible occasions.&nbsp; He favoured the establishment of 
convents in several parts of London.&nbsp; He was delighted to 
have the streets, and even the court itself, filled with Monks 
and Friars in the habits of their orders.&nbsp; He constantly 
endeavoured to make Catholics of the Protestants about him.&nbsp;
He held private interviews, which he called 
&lsquo;closetings,&rsquo; with those Members of Parliament who 
held offices, to persuade them to consent to the design he had in
view.&nbsp; When they did not consent, they were removed, or 
resigned of themselves, and their places were given to 
Catholics.&nbsp; He displaced Protestant officers from the army, 
by every means in his power, and got Catholics into their places 
too.&nbsp; He tried the same thing with the corporations, and 
also (though not so successfully) with the Lord Lieutenants of 
counties.&nbsp; To terrify the people into the endurance of all 
these measures, he kept an army of fifteen thousand men encamped 
on Hounslow Heath, where mass was openly performed in the 
General&rsquo;s tent, and where priests went among the soldiers 
endeavouring to persuade them to become Catholics.&nbsp; For 
circulating a paper among those men advising them to be true to 
their religion, a Protestant clergyman, named <span 
class="smcap">Johnson</span>, the chaplain of the late Lord 
Russell, was actually sentenced to stand three times in the 
pillory, and was actually whipped from Newgate to Tyburn.&nbsp; 
He dismissed his own brother-in-law from his Council because he 
was a Protestant, and made a Privy Councillor of the 
before-mentioned Father Petre.&nbsp; He handed Ireland over to 
<span class="smcap">Richard Talbot</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Earl of Tyrconnell</span>, a worthless, dissolute 
knave, who played the same game there for his master, and who 
played the deeper game for himself of one day putting it under 
the protection of the French King.&nbsp; In going to these 
extremities, every man of sense and judgment among the Catholics,
from the Pope to a porter, knew that the King was a mere bigoted 
fool, who would undo himself and the cause he sought to advance; 
but he was deaf to all reason, and, happily for England ever 
afterwards, went tumbling off his throne in his own blind 
way.</p>
<p>A spirit began to arise in the country, which the besotted 
blunderer little expected.&nbsp; He first found it out in the 
University of Cambridge.&nbsp; Having made a Catholic a dean at 
Oxford without any opposition, he tried to make a monk a master 
of arts at Cambridge: which attempt the University resisted, and 
defeated him.&nbsp; He then went back to his favourite 
Oxford.&nbsp; On the death of the President of Magdalen College, 
he commanded that there should be elected to succeed him, one 
<span class="smcap">Mr. Anthony Farmer</span>, whose only 
recommendation was, that he was of the King&rsquo;s 
religion.&nbsp; The University plucked up courage at last, and 
refused.&nbsp; The King substituted another man, and it still 
refused, resolving to stand by its own election of a <span 
class="smcap">Mr. Hough</span>.&nbsp; The dull tyrant, upon this,
punished Mr. Hough, and five-and-twenty more, by causing them to 
be expelled and declared incapable of holding any church 
preferment; then he proceeded to what he supposed to be his 
highest step, but to what was, in fact, his last plunge 
head-foremost in his tumble off his throne.</p>
<p>He had issued a declaration that there should be no religious 
tests or penal laws, in order to let in the Catholics more 
easily; but the Protestant dissenters, unmindful of themselves, 
had gallantly joined the regular church in opposing it tooth and 
nail.&nbsp; The King and Father Petre now resolved to have this 
read, on a certain Sunday, in all the churches, and to order it 
to be circulated for that purpose by the bishops.&nbsp; The 
latter took counsel with the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in
disgrace; and they resolved that the declaration should not be 
read, and that they would petition the King against it.&nbsp; The
Archbishop himself wrote out the petition, and six bishops went 
into the King&rsquo;s bedchamber the same night to present it, to
his infinite astonishment.&nbsp; Next day was the Sunday fixed 
for the reading, and it was only read by two hundred clergymen 
out of ten thousand.&nbsp; The King resolved against all advice 
to prosecute the bishops in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, and 
within three weeks they were summoned before the Privy Council, 
and committed to the Tower.&nbsp; As the six bishops were taken 
to that dismal place, by water, the people who were assembled in 
immense numbers fell upon their knees, and wept for them, and 
prayed for them.&nbsp; When they got to the Tower, the officers 
and soldiers on guard besought them for their blessing.&nbsp; 
While they were confined there, the soldiers every day drank to 
their release with loud shouts.&nbsp; When they were brought up 
to the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench for their trial, which the 
Attorney-General said was for the high offence of censuring the 
Government, and giving their opinion about affairs of state, they
were attended by similar multitudes, and surrounded by a throng 
of noblemen and gentlemen.&nbsp; When the jury went out at seven 
o&rsquo;clock at night to consider of their verdict, everybody 
(except the King) knew that they would rather starve than yield 
to the King&rsquo;s brewer, who was one of them, and wanted a 
verdict for his customer.&nbsp; When they came into court next 
morning, after resisting the brewer all night, and gave a verdict
of not guilty, such a shout rose up in Westminster Hall as it had
never heard before; and it was passed on among the people away to
Temple Bar, and away again to the Tower.&nbsp; It did not pass 
only to the east, but passed to the west too, until it reached 
the camp at Hounslow, where the fifteen thousand soldiers took it
up and echoed it.&nbsp; And still, when the dull King, who was 
then with Lord Feversham, heard the mighty roar, asked in alarm 
what it was, and was told that it was &lsquo;nothing but the 
acquittal of the bishops,&rsquo; he said, in his dogged way, 
&lsquo;Call you that nothing?&nbsp; It is so much the worse for 
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Between the petition and the trial, the Queen had given birth 
to a son, which Father Petre rather thought was owing to Saint 
Winifred.&nbsp; But I doubt if Saint Winifred had much to do with
it as the King&rsquo;s friend, inasmuch as the entirely new 
prospect of a Catholic successor (for both the King&rsquo;s 
daughters were Protestants) determined the <span 
class="smcap">Earls of Shrewsbury</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Danby</span>, and <span 
class="smcap">Devonshire</span>, <span class="smcap">Lord 
Lumley</span>, the <span class="smcap">Bishop of London</span>, 
<span class="smcap">Admiral Russell</span>, and <span 
class="smcap">Colonel Sidney</span>, to invite the Prince of 
Orange over to England.&nbsp; The Royal Mole, seeing his danger 
at last, made, in his fright, many great concessions, besides 
raising an army of forty thousand men; but the Prince of Orange 
was not a man for James the Second to cope with.&nbsp; His 
preparations were extraordinarily vigorous, and his mind was 
resolved.</p>
<p>For a fortnight after the Prince was ready to sail for 
England, a great wind from the west prevented the departure of 
his fleet.&nbsp; Even when the wind lulled, and it did sail, it 
was dispersed by a storm, and was obliged to put back to 
refit.&nbsp; At last, on the first of November, one thousand six 
hundred and eighty-eight, the Protestant east wind, as it was 
long called, began to blow; and on the third, the people of Dover
and the people of Calais saw a fleet twenty miles long sailing 
gallantly by, between the two places.&nbsp; On Monday, the fifth,
it anchored at Torbay in Devonshire, and the Prince, with a 
splendid retinue of officers and men, marched into Exeter.&nbsp; 
But the people in that western part of the country had suffered 
so much in The Bloody Assize, that they had lost heart.&nbsp; Few
people joined him; and he began to think of returning, and 
publishing the invitation he had received from those lords, as 
his justification for having come at all.&nbsp; At this crisis, 
some of the gentry joined him; the Royal army began to falter; an
engagement was signed, by which all who set their hand to it 
declared that they would support one another in defence of the 
laws and liberties of the three Kingdoms, of the Protestant 
religion, and of the Prince of Orange.&nbsp; From that time, the 
cause received no check; the greatest towns in England began, one
after another, to declare for the Prince; and he knew that it was
all safe with him when the University of Oxford offered to melt 
down its plate, if he wanted any money.</p>
<p>By this time the King was running about in a pitiable way, 
touching people for the King&rsquo;s evil in one place, reviewing
his troops in another, and bleeding from the nose in a 
third.&nbsp; The young Prince was sent to Portsmouth, Father 
Petre went off like a shot to France, and there was a general and
swift dispersal of all the priests and friars.&nbsp; One after 
another, the King&rsquo;s most important officers and friends 
deserted him and went over to the Prince.&nbsp; In the night, his
daughter Anne fled from Whitehall Palace; and the Bishop of 
London, who had once been a soldier, rode before her with a drawn
sword in his hand, and pistols at his saddle.&nbsp; &lsquo;God 
help me,&rsquo; cried the miserable King: &lsquo;my very children
have forsaken me!&rsquo;&nbsp; In his wildness, after debating 
with such lords as were in London, whether he should or should 
not call a Parliament, and after naming three of them to 
negotiate with the Prince, he resolved to fly to France.&nbsp; He
had the little Prince of Wales brought back from Portsmouth; and 
the child and the Queen crossed the river to Lambeth in an open 
boat, on a miserable wet night, and got safely away.&nbsp; This 
was on the night of the ninth of December.</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the eleventh, the King,
who had, in the meantime, received a letter from the Prince of 
Orange, stating his objects, got out of bed, told <span 
class="smcap">Lord Northumberland</span> who lay in his room not 
to open the door until the usual hour in the morning, and went 
down the back stairs (the same, I suppose, by which the priest in
the wig and gown had come up to his brother) and crossed the 
river in a small boat: sinking the great seal of England by the 
way.&nbsp; Horses having been provided, he rode, accompanied by 
<span class="smcap">Sir Edward Hales</span>, to Feversham, where 
he embarked in a Custom House Hoy.&nbsp; The master of this Hoy, 
wanting more ballast, ran into the Isle of Sheppy to get it, 
where the fishermen and smugglers crowded about the boat, and 
informed the King of their suspicions that he was a 
&lsquo;hatchet-faced Jesuit.&rsquo;&nbsp; As they took his money 
and would not let him go, he told them who he was, and that the 
Prince of Orange wanted to take his life; and he began to scream 
for a boat&mdash;and then to cry, because he had lost a piece of 
wood on his ride which he called a fragment of Our 
Saviour&rsquo;s cross.&nbsp; He put himself into the hands of the
Lord Lieutenant of the county, and his detention was made known 
to the Prince of Orange at Windsor&mdash;who, only wanting to get
rid of him, and not caring where he went, so that he went away, 
was very much disconcerted that they did not let him go.&nbsp; 
However, there was nothing for it but to have him brought back, 
with some state in the way of Life Guards, to Whitehall.&nbsp; 
And as soon as he got there, in his infatuation, he heard mass, 
and set a Jesuit to say grace at his public dinner.</p>
<p>The people had been thrown into the strangest state of 
confusion by his flight, and had taken it into their heads that 
the Irish part of the army were going to murder the 
Protestants.&nbsp; Therefore, they set the bells a ringing, and 
lighted watch-fires, and burned Catholic Chapels, and looked 
about in all directions for Father Petre and the Jesuits, while 
the Pope&rsquo;s ambassador was running away in the dress of a 
footman.&nbsp; They found no Jesuits; but a man, who had once 
been a frightened witness before Jeffreys in court, saw a 
swollen, drunken face looking through a window down at Wapping, 
which he well remembered.&nbsp; The face was in a sailor&rsquo;s 
dress, but he knew it to be the face of that accursed judge, and 
he seized him.&nbsp; The people, to their lasting honour, did not
tear him to pieces.&nbsp; After knocking him about a little, they
took him, in the basest agonies of terror, to the Lord Mayor, who
sent him, at his own shrieking petition, to the Tower for 
safety.&nbsp; There, he died.</p>
<p>Their bewilderment continuing, the people now lighted bonfires
and made rejoicings, as if they had any reason to be glad to have
the King back again.&nbsp; But, his stay was very short, for the 
English guards were removed from Whitehall, Dutch guards were 
marched up to it, and he was told by one of his late ministers 
that the Prince would enter London, next day, and he had better 
go to Ham.&nbsp; He said, Ham was a cold, damp place, and he 
would rather go to Rochester.&nbsp; He thought himself very 
cunning in this, as he meant to escape from Rochester to 
France.&nbsp; The Prince of Orange and his friends knew that, 
perfectly well, and desired nothing more.&nbsp; So, he went to 
Gravesend, in his royal barge, attended by certain lords, and 
watched by Dutch troops, and pitied by the generous people, who 
were far more forgiving than he had ever been, when they saw him 
in his humiliation.&nbsp; On the night of the twenty-third of 
December, not even then understanding that everybody wanted to 
get rid of him, he went out, absurdly, through his Rochester 
garden, down to the Medway, and got away to France, where he 
rejoined the Queen.</p>
<p>There had been a council in his absence, of the lords, and the
authorities of London.&nbsp; When the Prince came, on the day 
after the King&rsquo;s departure, he summoned the Lords to meet 
him, and soon afterwards, all those who had served in any of the 
Parliaments of King Charles the Second.&nbsp; It was finally 
resolved by these authorities that the throne was vacant by the 
conduct of King James the Second; that it was inconsistent with 
the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom, to be governed
by a Popish prince; that the Prince and Princess of Orange should
be King and Queen during their lives and the life of the survivor
of them; and that their children should succeed them, if they had
any.&nbsp; That if they had none, the Princess Anne and her 
children should succeed; that if she had none, the heirs of the 
Prince of Orange should succeed.</p>
<p>On the thirteenth of January, one thousand six hundred and 
eighty-nine, the Prince and Princess, sitting on a throne in 
Whitehall, bound themselves to these conditions.&nbsp; The 
Protestant religion was established in England, and 
England&rsquo;s great and glorious Revolution was complete.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<p>I have now arrived at the close of my little history.&nbsp; 
The events which succeeded the famous Revolution of one thousand 
six hundred and eighty-eight, would neither be easily related nor
easily understood in such a book as this.</p>
<p>William and Mary reigned together, five years.&nbsp; After the
death of his good wife, William occupied the throne, alone, for 
seven years longer.&nbsp; During his reign, on the sixteenth of 
September, one thousand seven hundred and one, the poor weak 
creature who had once been James the Second of England, died in 
France.&nbsp; In the meantime he had done his utmost (which was 
not much) to cause William to be assassinated, and to regain his 
lost dominions.&nbsp; James&rsquo;s son was declared, by the 
French King, the rightful King of England; and was called in 
France <span class="smcap">The Chevalier Saint George</span>, and
in England <span class="smcap">The Pretender</span>.&nbsp; Some 
infatuated people in England, and particularly in Scotland, took 
up the Pretender&rsquo;s cause from time to time&mdash;as if the 
country had not had Stuarts enough!&mdash;and many lives were 
sacrificed, and much misery was occasioned.&nbsp; King William 
died on Sunday, the seventh of March, one thousand seven hundred 
and two, of the consequences of an accident occasioned by his 
horse stumbling with him.&nbsp; He was always a brave, patriotic 
Prince, and a man of remarkable abilities.&nbsp; His manner was 
cold, and he made but few friends; but he had truly loved his 
queen.&nbsp; When he was dead, a lock of her hair, in a ring, was
found tied with a black ribbon round his left arm.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by the <span class="smcap">Princess 
Anne</span>, a popular Queen, who reigned twelve years.&nbsp; In 
her reign, in the month of May, one thousand seven hundred and 
seven, the Union between England and Scotland was effected, and 
the two countries were incorporated under the name of <span 
class="smcap">Great Britain</span>.&nbsp; Then, from the year one
thousand seven hundred and fourteen to the year one thousand, 
eight hundred and thirty, reigned the four <span 
class="smcap">Georges</span>.</p>
<p>It was in the reign of George the Second, one thousand seven 
hundred and forty-five, that the Pretender did his last mischief,
and made his last appearance.&nbsp; Being an old man by that 
time, he and the Jacobites&mdash;as his friends were 
called&mdash;put forward his son, <span class="smcap">Charles 
Edward</span>, known as the young Chevalier.&nbsp; The 
Highlanders of Scotland, an extremely troublesome and 
wrong-headed race on the subject of the Stuarts, espoused his 
cause, and he joined them, and there was a Scottish rebellion to 
make him king, in which many gallant and devoted gentlemen lost 
their lives.&nbsp; It was a hard matter for Charles Edward to 
escape abroad again, with a high price on his head; but the 
Scottish people were extraordinarily faithful to him, and, after 
undergoing many romantic adventures, not unlike those of Charles 
the Second, he escaped to France.&nbsp; A number of charming 
stories and delightful songs arose out of the Jacobite feelings, 
and belong to the Jacobite times.&nbsp; Otherwise I think the 
Stuarts were a public nuisance altogether.</p>
<p>It was in the reign of George the Third that England lost 
North America, by persisting in taxing her without her own 
consent.&nbsp; That immense country, made independent under <span
class="smcap">Washington</span>, and left to itself, became the 
United States; one of the greatest nations of the earth.&nbsp; In
these times in which I write, it is honourably remarkable for 
protecting its subjects, wherever they may travel, with a dignity
and a determination which is a model for England.&nbsp; Between 
you and me, England has rather lost ground in this respect since 
the days of Oliver Cromwell.</p>
<p>The Union of Great Britain with Ireland&mdash;which had been 
getting on very ill by itself&mdash;took place in the reign of 
George the Third, on the second of July, one thousand seven 
hundred and ninety-eight.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William the Fourth</span> succeeded George
the Fourth, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty, 
and reigned seven years.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Queen 
Victoria</span>, his niece, the only child of the Duke of Kent, 
the fourth son of George the Third, came to the throne on the 
twentieth of June, one thousand eight hundred and 
thirty-seven.&nbsp; She was married to <span class="smcap">Prince
Albert</span> of Saxe Gotha on the tenth of February, one 
thousand eight hundred and forty.&nbsp; She is very good, and 
much beloved.&nbsp; So I end, like the crier, with</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
