      BOOK I<br />
    </h3>
    <p class="poem">
      Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,<br /> And haughty Juno's
      unrelenting hate,<br /> Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.<br />
      Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,<br /> And in the doubtful war,
      before he won<br /> The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;<br /> His
      banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,<br /> And settled sure succession
      in his line,<br /> From whence the race of Alban fathers come,<br /> And the
      long glories of majestic Rome.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;<br /> What goddess was provok'd,
      and whence her hate;<br /> For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began<br />
      To persecute so brave, so just a man;<br /> Involv'd his anxious life in
      endless cares,<br /> Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!<br /> Can
      heav'nly minds such high resentment show,<br /> Or exercise their spite in
      human woe?<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,<br /> An ancient town was seated
      on the sea;<br /> A Tyrian colony; the people made<br /> Stout for the war,
      and studious of their trade:<br /> Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more<br />
      Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.<br /> Here stood her chariot;
      here, if Heav'n were kind,<br /> The seat of awful empire she design'd.<br />
      Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,<br /> (Long cited by the people of
      the sky,)<br /> That times to come should see the Trojan race<br /> Her
      Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;<br /> Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of
      sov'reign sway<br /> Should on the necks of all the nations lay.<br /> She
      ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;<br /> Nor could forget the war
      she wag'd of late<br /> For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.<br />
      Besides, long causes working in her mind,<br /> And secret seeds of envy,
      lay behind;<br /> Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd<br /> Of
      partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;<br /> The grace bestow'd on ravish'd
      Ganymed,<br /> Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.<br /> Each was a
      cause alone; and all combin'd<br /> To kindle vengeance in her haughty
      mind.<br /> For this, far distant from the Latian coast<br /> She drove the
      remnants of the Trojan host;<br /> And sev'n long years th' unhappy
      wand'ring train<br /> Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.<br />
      Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,<br /> Such length of labor
      for so vast a frame.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,<br /> Had left behind the
      fair Sicilian shores,<br /> Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,<br />
      And plowing frothy furrows in the main;<br /> When, lab'ring still with
      endless discontent,<br /> The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent:<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?" said she,<br /> "And must the Trojans
      reign in Italy?<br /> So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;<br />
      Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.<br /> Could angry Pallas, with
      revengeful spleen,<br /> The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?<br />
      She, for the fault of one offending foe,<br /> The bolts of Jove himself
      presum'd to throw:<br /> With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,<br />
      And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;<br /> Then, as an eagle gripes the
      trembling game,<br /> The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,<br />
      She strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound<br /> Transfix'd, and naked,
      on a rock she bound.<br /> But I, who walk in awful state above,<br /> The
      majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove,<br /> For length of years my
      fruitless force employ<br /> Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy!<br />
      What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray,<br /> Or off'rings on my
      slighted altars lay?"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.<br /> The restless regions
      of the storms she sought,<br /> Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,<br />
      The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,<br /> With pow'r imperial curbs
      the struggling winds,<br /> And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.<br />
      This way and that th' impatient captives tend,<br /> And, pressing for
      release, the mountains rend.<br /> High in his hall th' undaunted monarch
      stands,<br /> And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;<br /> Which
      did he not, their unresisted sway<br /> Would sweep the world before them
      in their way;<br /> Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,<br />
      And heav'n would fly before the driving soul.<br /> In fear of this, the
      Father of the Gods<br /> Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,<br /> And
      lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;<br /> Impos'd a
      king, with arbitrary sway,<br /> To loose their fetters, or their force
      allay.<br /> To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,<br /> And
      thus the tenor of her suit express'd:<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n<br /> The pow'r of tempests and
      of winds has giv'n;<br /> Thy force alone their fury can restrain,<br /> And
      smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main-<br /> A race of wand'ring
      slaves, abhorr'd by me,<br /> With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;<br />
      To fruitful Italy their course they steer,<br /> And for their vanquish'd
      gods design new temples there.<br /> Raise all thy winds; with night
      involve the skies;<br /> Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.<br /> Twice
      sev'n, the charming daughters of the main,<br /> Around my person wait, and
      bear my train:<br /> Succeed my wish, and second my design;<br /> The
      fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,<br /> And make thee father of a happy
      line."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      To this the god: "'T is yours, O queen, to will<br /> The work which duty
      binds me to fulfil.<br /> These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,<br />
      Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:<br /> Yours is my sov'reign's
      grace; and, as your guest,<br /> I sit with gods at their celestial feast;<br />
      Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;<br /> Dispose of empire, which
      I hold from you."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side<br /> His quiv'ring spear,
      and all the god applied.<br /> The raging winds rush thro' the hollow
      wound,<br /> And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;<br /> Then,
      settling on the sea, the surges sweep,<br /> Raise liquid mountains, and
      disclose the deep.<br /> South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar,<br />
      And roll the foaming billows to the shore.<br /> The cables crack; the
      sailors' fearful cries<br /> Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;<br />
      And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes.<br /> Loud peals of thunder
      from the poles ensue;<br /> Then flashing fires the transient light renew;<br />
      The face of things a frightful image bears,<br /> And present death in
      various forms appears.<br /> Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,<br />
      With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;<br /> And, "Thrice and four
      times happy those," he cried,<br /> "That under Ilian walls before their
      parents died!<br /> Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!<br /> Why could
      not I by that strong arm be slain,<br /> And lie by noble Hector on the
      plain,<br /> Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields<br /> Where Simois
      rolls the bodies and the shields<br /> Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands
      yet bear<br /> The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,<br /> Fierce Boreas drove
      against his flying sails,<br /> And rent the sheets; the raging billows
      rise,<br /> And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:<br /> Nor can the
      shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;<br /> The galley gives her side, and turns
      her prow;<br /> While those astern, descending down the steep,<br /> Thro'
      gaping waves behold the boiling deep.<br /> Three ships were hurried by the
      southern blast,<br /> And on the secret shelves with fury cast.<br /> Those
      hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew:<br /> They call'd them Altars, when
      they rose in view,<br /> And show'd their spacious backs above the flood.<br />
      Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,<br /> Dash'd on the shallows of
      the moving sand,<br /> And in mid ocean left them moor'd aland.<br />
      Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,<br /> (A horrid sight!) ev'n in
      the hero's view,<br /> From stem to stern by waves was overborne:<br /> The
      trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,<br /> Was headlong hurl'd; thrice
      round the ship was toss'd,<br /> Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was
      lost;<br /> And here and there above the waves were seen<br /> Arms,
      pictures, precious goods, and floating men.<br /> The stoutest vessel to
      the storm gave way,<br /> And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.<br />
      Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,<br /> Achates faithful, Abas young and
      bold,<br /> Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,<br /> Admit
      the deluge of the briny streams.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound<br /> Of raging billows breaking
      on the ground.<br /> Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,<br /> He
      rear'd his awful head above the main,<br /> Serene in majesty; then roll'd
      his eyes<br /> Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.<br /> He saw
      the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,<br /> By stormy winds and wintry
      heav'n oppress'd.<br /> Full well the god his sister's envy knew,<br /> And
      what her aims and what her arts pursue.<br /> He summon'd Eurus and the
      western blast,<br /> And first an angry glance on both he cast;<br /> Then
      thus rebuk'd: "Audacious winds! from whence<br /> This bold attempt, this
      rebel insolence?<br /> Is it for you to ravage seas and land,<br />
      Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command?<br /> To raise such mountains on the
      troubled main?<br /> Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain;<br />
      And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.<br /> Hence! to your
      lord my royal mandate bear-<br /> The realms of ocean and the fields of air<br />
      Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me<br /> The liquid empire fell, and
      trident of the sea.<br /> His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd:<br />
      There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,<br /> With hoarse commands his
      breathing subjects call,<br /> And boast and bluster in his empty hall."<br />
      He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea,<br /> Dispell'd the
      darkness, and restor'd the day.<br /> Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green
      train<br /> Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,<br /> Clear from
      the rocks the vessels with their hands:<br /> The god himself with ready
      trident stands,<br /> And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;<br />
      Then heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides<br /> His finny
      coursers and in triumph rides,<br /> The waves unruffle and the sea
      subsides.<br /> As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd,<br /> Mad are
      their motions, and their tongues are loud;<br /> And stones and brands in
      rattling volleys fly,<br /> And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:<br />
      If then some grave and pious man appear,<br /> They hush their noise, and
      lend a list'ning ear;<br /> He soothes with sober words their angry mood,<br />
      And quenches their innate desire of blood:<br /> So, when the Father of the
      Flood appears,<br /> And o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears,<br />
      Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,<br /> High on his chariot,
      and, with loosen'd reins,<br /> Majestic moves along, and awful peace
      maintains.<br /> The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars<br /> To nearest
      land, and make the Libyan shores.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Within a long recess there lies a bay:<br /> An island shades it from the
      rolling sea,<br /> And forms a port secure for ships to ride;<br /> Broke by
      the jutting land, on either side,<br /> In double streams the briny waters
      glide.<br /> Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene<br /> Appears above,
      and groves for ever green:<br /> A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy
      seats,<br /> To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats.<br /> Down thro'
      the crannies of the living walls<br /> The crystal streams descend in
      murm'ring falls:<br /> No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,<br /> Nor
      bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.<br /> Sev'n ships within this
      happy harbor meet,<br /> The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet.<br />
      The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,<br /> Leap on the
      welcome land, and seek their wish'd repose.<br />

      First, good Achates, with repeated strokes<br /> Of clashing flints, their
      hidden fire provokes:<br /> Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves<br />
      The dying sparkles in their fall receives:<br /> Caught into life, in fiery
      fumes they rise,<br /> And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.<br />
      The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around<br /> The cheerful blaze, or lie
      along the ground:<br /> Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,<br />
      Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.<br /> Aeneas climbs the
      mountain's airy brow,<br /> And takes a prospect of the seas below,<br /> If
      Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,<br /> Or see the streamers of Caicus
      fly.<br /> No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,<br /> Three beamy
      stags command a lordly train<br /> Of branching heads: the more ignoble
      throng<br /> Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.<br /> He
      stood; and, while secure they fed below,<br /> He took the quiver and the
      trusty bow<br /> Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first<br /> He laid
      along, and then the vulgar pierc'd;<br /> Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the
      shady plain<br /> Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain.<br /> For
      the sev'n ships he made an equal share,<br /> And to the port return'd,
      triumphant from the war.<br /> The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift,<br />
      When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)<br /> He set abroach, and for the
      feast prepar'd,<br /> In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd.<br /> Thus
      while he dealt it round, the pious chief<br /> With cheerful words allay'd
      the common grief:<br /> "Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose<br />
      To future good our past and present woes.<br /> With me, the rocks of
      Scylla you have tried;<br /> Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.<br />
      What greater ills hereafter can you bear?<br /> Resume your courage and
      dismiss your care,<br /> An hour will come, with pleasure to relate<br />
      Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.<br /> Thro' various hazards and
      events, we move<br /> To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove.<br />
      Call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies)<br /> Where Trojan kingdoms
      once again may rise,<br /> Endure the hardships of your present state;<br />
      Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate."<br />

    <p class="poem">
      These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;<br /> His outward
      smiles conceal'd his inward smart.<br /> The jolly crew, unmindful of the
      past,<br /> The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.<br /> Some strip
      the skin; some portion out the spoil;<br /> The limbs, yet trembling, in
      the caldrons boil;<br /> Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.<br />
      Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,<br /> Restore their
      strength with meat, and cheer their souls with<br /> wine.<br /> Their
      hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends<br /> The doubtful fortune of
      their absent friends:<br /> Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,<br />
      Whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.<br /> Above the rest, Aeneas
      mourns the fate<br /> Of brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state<br /> Of

      recesses of the wood,<br /> Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:<br />
      A huntress in her habit and her mien;<br /> Her dress a maid, her air
      confess'd a queen.<br /> Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;<br />
      Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind;<br /> Her hand sustain'd a
      bow; her quiver hung behind.<br /> She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan
      blood:<br /> With such array Harpalyce bestrode<br /> Her Thracian courser

      will sum in short. Sichaeus, known<br /> For wealth, and brother to the
      Punic throne,<br /> Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart<br /> At
      once was wounded with an equal dart.<br /> Her father gave her, yet a
      spotless maid;<br /> Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd:<br /> One who
      condemn'd divine and human laws.<br /> Then strife ensued, and cursed gold
      the cause.<br /> The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,<br /> With
      steel invades his brother's life by stealth;<br /> Before the sacred altar
      made him bleed,<br /> And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed.<br /> Some
      tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd,<br /> To soothe his sister, and
      delude her mind.<br /> At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears<br />
      Of her unhappy lord: the specter stares,<br /> And, with erected eyes, his
      bloody bosom bares.<br /> The cruel altars and his fate he tells,<br /> And
      the dire secret of his house reveals,<br /> Then warns the widow, with her
      household gods,<br /> To seek a refuge in remote abodes.<br /> Last, to
      support her in so long a way,<br /> He shows her where his hidden treasure
      lay.<br /> Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright,<br /> The queen
      provides companions of her flight:<br /> They meet, and all combine to
      leave the state,<br /> Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.<br /> They
      seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find;<br /> Nor is Pygmalion's
      treasure left behind.<br /> The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea<br /> With
      prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way.<br /> I know not, if by stress of
      weather driv'n,<br /> Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n;<br /> At
      last they landed, where from far your eyes<br /> May view the turrets of
      new Carthage rise;<br /> There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa

      above;<br /> Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along,<br /> And thro'
      the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng:<br /> Now, all united in a goodly
      team,<br /> They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.<br /> As they,
      with joy returning, clap their wings,<br /> And ride the circuit of the

      train descends her sweeping gown;<br /> And, by her graceful walk, the
      Queen of Love is known.<br /> The prince pursued the parting deity<br />
      With words like these: "Ah! whither do you fly?<br /> Unkind and cruel! to
      deceive your son<br /> In borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun;<br />
      Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;<br /> And still to speak in
      accents not your own."<br /> Against the goddess these complaints he made,<br />
      But took the path, and her commands obey'd.<br /> They march, obscure; for
      Venus kindly shrouds<br /> With mists their persons, and involves in
      clouds,<br /> That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,<br /> Or
      force to tell the causes of their way.<br /> This part perform'd, the
      goddess flies sublime<br /> To visit Paphos and her native clime;<br />
      Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,<br /> With vows are offer'd, and
      with solemn pray'r:<br /> A hundred altars in her temple smoke;<br /> A
      thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke.<br />

      They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,<br /> Now at a nearer
      distance view the town.<br /> The prince with wonder sees the stately

      gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part,<br /> The noise and busy
      concourse of the mart.<br /> The toiling Tyrians on each other call<br /> To
      ply their labor: some extend the wall;<br /> Some build the citadel; the
      brawny throng<br /> Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along.<br /> Some for
      their dwellings choose a spot of ground,<br /> Which, first design'd, with
      ditches they surround.<br /> Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice<br />
      Of holy senates, and elect by voice.<br /> Here some design a mole, while
      others there<br /> Lay deep foundations for a theater;<br /> From marble
      quarries mighty columns hew,<br /> For ornaments of scenes, and future
      view.<br /> Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,<br /> As exercise
      the bees in flow'ry plains,<br /> When winter past, and summer scarce
      begun,<br /> Invites them forth to labor in the sun;<br /> Some lead their
      youth abroad, while some condense<br /> Their liquid store, and some in
      cells dispense;<br /> Some at the gate stand ready to receive<br /> The
      golden burthen, and their friends relieve;<br /> All with united force,
      combine to drive<br /> The lazy drones from the laborious hive:<br /> With
      envy stung, they view each other's deeds;<br /> The fragrant work with
      diligence proceeds.<br /> "Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!"<br />
      Aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes,<br /> Their lofty tow'rs; then,
      entiring at the gate,<br /> Conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate)<br />

      Full in the center of the town there stood,<br /> Thick set with trees, a

      head they drew,<br /> Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.<br />
      This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,<br /> Of a soil fruitful, and a
      people brave.<br /> Sidonian Dido here with solemn state<br /> Did Juno's
      temple build, and consecrate,<br /> Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden
      shrine;<br /> But more the goddess made the place divine.<br /> On brazen
      steps the marble threshold rose,<br /> And brazen plates the cedar beams
      inclose:<br /> The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd;<br /> The
      lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.<br /> What first Aeneas this place
      beheld,<br /> Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.<br /> For while,
      expecting there the queen, he rais'd<br /> His wond'ring eyes, and round
      the temple gaz'd,<br /> Admir'd the fortune of the rising town,<br /> The
      striving artists, and their arts' renown;<br /> He saw, in order painted on
      the wall,<br /> Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:<br /> The wars that fame
      around the world had blown,<br /> All to the life, and ev'ry leader known.<br />
      There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,<br /> And fierce Achilles, who both
      kings defies.<br /> He stopp'd, and weeping said: "O friend! ev'n here<br />
      The monuments of Trojan woes appear!<br /> Our known disasters fill ev'n
      foreign lands:<br /> See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!<br /> Ev'n
      the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,<br /> And Trojan griefs the
      Tyrians' pity claim."<br /> He said (his tears a ready passage find),<br />
      Devouring what he saw so well design'd,<br /> And with an empty picture fed
      his mind:<br /> For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,<br /> And here
      the trembling Trojans quit the field,<br /> Pursued by fierce Achilles
      thro' the plain,<br /> On his high chariot driving o'er the slain.<br /> The
      tents of Rhesus next his grief renew,<br /> By their white sails betray'd
      to nightly view;<br /> And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword<br /> The
      sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord,<br /> Then took the fiery
      steeds, ere yet the food<br /> Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian
      flood.<br /> Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied<br /> Achilles, and
      unequal combat tried;<br /> Then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd
      reins,<br /> Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,<br /> Hung by the
      neck and hair, and dragg'd around:<br /> The hostile spear, yet sticking in
      his wound,<br /> With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.<br />
      Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,<br /> To Pallas' fane in
      long procession go,<br /> In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.<br />
      They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,<br /> And rich
      embroider'd vests for presents bear;<br /> But the stern goddess stands
      unmov'd with pray'r.<br /> Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew<br />
      The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.<br /> Here Priam sues; and
      there, for sums of gold,<br /> The lifeless body of his son is sold.<br />
      So sad an object, and so well express'd,<br /> Drew sighs and groans from
      the griev'd hero's breast,<br /> To see the figure of his lifeless friend,<br />
      And his old sire his helpless hand extend.<br /> Himself he saw amidst the
      Grecian train,<br /> Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;<br /> And
      swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,<br /> His pompous ensigns, and his
      Indian crew.<br /> Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,<br /> Leads to the
      wars an Amazonian race:<br /> In their right hands a pointed dart they
      wield;<br /> The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.<br /> Athwart
      her breast a golden belt she throws,<br /> Amidst the press alone provokes
      a thousand foes,<br /> And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,<br /> Fix'd on the walls
      with wonder and surprise,<br /> The beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train<br />
      And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.<br /> Such on Eurotas' banks,
      or Cynthus' height,<br /> Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,<br />
      When in the dance the graceful goddess leads<br /> The choir of nymphs, and
      overtops their heads:<br /> Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,<br />
      She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;<br /> Latona sees her shine
      above the rest,<br /> And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.<br />
      Such Dido was; with such becoming state,<br /> Amidst the crowd, she walks
      serenely great.<br /> Their labor to her future sway she speeds,<br /> And
      passing with a gracious glance proceeds;<br /> Then mounts the throne, high
      plac'd before the shrine:<br /> In crowds around, the swarming people join.<br />
      She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,<br /> Hears and determines ev'ry
      private cause;<br /> Their tasks in equal portions she divides,<br /> And,
      where unequal, there by lots decides.<br /> Another way by chance Aeneas
      bends<br /> His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,<br /> Antheus,
      Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,<br /> And at their backs a mighty Trojan
      throng,<br /> Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd,<br /> And widely
      scatter'd on another coast.<br /> The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder
      stands,<br /> And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;<br /> But,
      doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays,<br /> And from the hollow cloud his
      friends surveys,<br /> Impatient till they told their present state,<br />
      And where they left their ships, and what their fate,<br /> And why they
      came, and what was their request;<br /> For these were sent, commission'd
      by the rest,<br /> To sue for leave to land their sickly men,<br /> And gain
      admission to the gracious queen.<br /> Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the
      holy fane;<br /> Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods<br /> To found an empire in these
      new abodes,<br /> To build a town, with statutes to restrain<br /> The wild
      inhabitants beneath thy reign,<br /> We wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry
      shore,<br /> From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.<br /> Forbid the fires
      our shipping to deface!<br /> Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace,<br />
      And spare the remnant of a pious race!<br /> We come not with design of
      wasteful prey,<br /> To drive the country, force the swains away:<br /> Nor
      such our strength, nor such is our desire;<br /> The vanquish'd dare not to
      such thoughts aspire.<br /> A land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old;<br />
      The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold-<br /> Th' Oenotrians held it
      once- by common fame<br /> Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.<br />
      To that sweet region was our voyage bent,<br /> When winds and ev'ry
      warring element<br /> Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land,<br />
      Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:<br /> The sea came on; the South,
      with mighty roar,<br /> Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore.<br />
      Those few you see escap'd the Storm, and fear,<br /> Unless you interpose,
      a shipwreck here.<br /> What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,<br />
      What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place,<br /> Shut up a desart
      shore to drowning men,<br /> And drive us to the cruel seas again?<br /> If
      our hard fortune no compassion draws,<br /> Nor hospitable rights, nor
      human laws,<br /> The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.<br />
      Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,<br /> Or nobler warrior, never drew a
      sword;<br /> Observant of the right, religious of his word.<br /> If yet he
      lives, and draws this vital air,<br /> Nor we, his friends, of safety shall
      despair;<br /> Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,<br /> Which he
      will equal, and perhaps augment.<br /> We want not cities, nor Sicilian
      coasts,<br /> Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.<br /> Permit our
      ships a shelter on your shores,<br /> Refitted from your woods with planks
      and oars,<br /> That, if our prince be safe, we may renew<br /> Our destin'd
      course, and Italy pursue.<br /> But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain<br />
      That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main,<br /> And if our young Iulus be
      no more,<br /> Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,<br /> That we to
      good Acestes may return,<br /> And with our friends our common losses
      mourn."<br /> Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew<br /> With cries and
      clamors his request renew.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,<br /> Ponder'd the speech;
      then briefly thus replies:<br /> "Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel
      fate,<br /> And doubts attending an unsettled state,<br /> Force me to guard
      my coast from foreign foes.<br /> Who has not heard the story of your woes,<br />
      The name and fortune of your native place,<br /> The fame and valor of the
      Phrygian race?<br /> We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,<br /> Nor so
      remote from Phoebus' influence.<br /> Whether to Latian shores your course
      is bent,<br /> Or, driv'n by tempests from your first intent,<br /> You seek
      the good Acestes' government,<br /> Your men shall be receiv'd, your fleet
      repair'd,<br /> And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:<br /> Or,
      would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs<br /> To raise and to defend
      the Tyrian tow'rs,<br /> My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.<br /> And
      would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would bring<br /> On Carthaginian
      coasts your wand'ring king.<br /> My people shall, by my command, explore<br />
      The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore,<br /> And towns, and wilds,
      and shady woods, in quest<br /> Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood,<br /> And long'd to break from
      out his ambient cloud:<br /> Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way:<br />
      "From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?<br /> What more can you
      desire, your welcome sure,<br /> Your fleet in safety, and your friends
      secure?<br /> One only wants; and him we saw in vain<br /> Oppose the Storm,
      and swallow'd in the main.<br /> Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;<br />
      The rest agrees with what your mother said."<br /> Scarce had he spoken,
      when the cloud gave way,<br /> The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight,<br /> August in visage, and
      serenely bright.<br /> His mother goddess, with her hands divine,<br /> Had
      form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine,<br /> And giv'n his
      rolling eyes a sparkling grace,<br /> And breath'd a youthful vigor on his
      face;<br /> Like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold,<br /> Or Parian
      marble, when enchas'd in gold:<br /> Thus radiant from the circling cloud
      he broke,<br /> And thus with manly modesty he spoke:<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd,<br /> And sav'd from shipwreck
      on your Libyan coast;<br /> Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,<br />
      A prince that owes his life to you alone.<br /> Fair majesty, the refuge
      and redress<br /> Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,<br /> You,
      who your pious offices employ<br /> To save the relics of abandon'd Troy;<br />
      Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore,<br /> With hospitable rites
      relieve the poor;<br /> Associate in your town a wand'ring train,<br /> And
      strangers in your palace entertain:<br /> What thanks can wretched
      fugitives return,<br /> Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn?<br />
      The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd;<br /> If acts of mercy touch
      their heav'nly mind,<br /> And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous
      heart.<br /> Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!<br /> In you this
      age is happy, and this earth,<br /> And parents more than mortal gave you
      birth.<br /> While rolling rivers into seas shall run,<br /> And round the
      space of heav'n the radiant sun;<br /> While trees the mountain tops with
      shades supply,<br /> Your honor, name, and praise shall never die.<br />
      Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd,<br /> Your image shall be present
      in my mind."<br /> Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste,<br /> And
      joyful his expecting friends embrac'd:<br /> With his right hand Ilioneus
      was grac'd,<br /> Serestus with his left; then to his breast<br /> Cloanthus
      and the noble Gyas press'd;<br /> And so by turns descended to the rest.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face,<br /> Pleas'd with his motions,
      ravish'd with his grace;<br /> Admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man;<br />
      Then recollected stood, and thus began:<br /> "What fate, O goddess-born;
      what angry pow'rs<br /> Have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores?<br />
      Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame,<br /> Who from celestial seed your
      lineage claim?<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore<br /> To fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean
      shore?<br /> It calls into my mind, tho' then a child,<br /> When Teucer
      came, from Salamis exil'd,<br /> And sought my father's aid, to be
      restor'd:<br /> My father Belus then with fire and sword<br /> Invaded
      Cyprus, made the region bare,<br /> And, conqu'ring, finish'd the
      successful war.<br /> From him the Trojan siege I understood,<br /> The
      Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.<br /> Your foe himself the
      Dardan valor prais'd,<br /> And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd.<br />
      Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,<br /> If not a costly welcome,
      yet a kind:<br /> For I myself, like you, have been distress'd,<br /> Till
      Heav'n afforded me this place of rest;<br /> Like you, an alien in a land
      unknown,<br /> I learn to pity woes so like my own."<br /> She said, and to
      the palace led her guest;<br /> Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a
      feast.<br /> Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,<br /> Twice ten
      fat oxen to the ships she sends;<br /> Besides a hundred boars, a hundred
      lambs,<br /> With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;<br /> And jars of
      gen'rous wine and spacious bowls<br /> She gives, to cheer the sailors'
      drooping souls.<br /> Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls,<br /> And
      sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:<br /> On Tyrian carpets,
      richly wrought, they dine;<br /> With loads of massy plate the sideboards
      shine,<br /> And antique vases, all of gold emboss'd<br /> (The gold itself
      inferior to the cost),<br /> Of curious work, where on the sides were seen<br />
      The fights and figures of illustrious men,<br /> From their first founder
      to the present queen.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The good Aeneas, paternal care<br /> Iulus' absence could no longer bear,<br />
      Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste,<br /> To give a glad relation of
      the past,<br /> And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,<br />
      Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy:<br /> A robe of tissue, stiff with
      golden wire;<br /> An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire,<br /> From Argos
      by the fam'd adultress brought,<br /> With golden flow'rs and winding
      foliage wrought,<br /> Her mother Leda's present, when she came<br /> To
      ruin Troy and set the world on flame;<br /> The scepter Priam's eldest
      daughter bore,<br /> Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore<br /> Of
      double texture, glorious to behold,<br /> One order set with gems, and one
      with gold.<br /> Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,<br /> And in his
      diligence his duty shows.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs,<br /> New counsels tries, and new
      designs prepares:<br /> That Cupid should assume the shape and face<br /> Of
      sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace;<br /> Should bring the presents,
      in her nephew's stead,<br /> And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:<br />
      For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued,<br /> And knew the town to
      Juno's care belong'd.<br /> These thoughts by night her golden slumbers
      broke,<br /> And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke:<br /> "My son, my
      strength, whose mighty pow'r alone<br /> Controls the Thund'rer on his
      awful throne,<br /> To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,<br /> And on
      thy succor and thy faith relies.<br /> Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's
      revengeful wife,<br /> By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;<br />
      And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.<br /> Him Dido now with
      blandishment detains;<br /> But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.<br />
      For this 't is needful to prevent her art,<br /> And fire with love the
      proud Phoenician's heart:<br /> A love so violent, so strong, so sure,<br />
      As neither age can change, nor art can cure.<br /> How this may be
      perform'd, now take my mind:<br /> Ascanius by his father is design'd<br />
      To come, with presents laden, from the port,<br /> To gratify the queen,
      and gain the court.<br /> I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,<br />
      And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep,<br /> Or high Cythera, that the
      sweet deceit<br /> May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.<br /> Take
      thou his form and shape. I beg the grace<br /> But only for a night's
      revolving space:<br /> Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face;<br />
      That when, amidst the fervor of the feast,<br /> The Tyrian hugs and fonds
      thee on her breast,<br /> And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,<br />
      Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins."<br /> The God of Love obeys,
      and sets aside<br /> His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;<br /> He walks
      Iulus in his mother's sight,<br /> And in the sweet resemblance takes
      delight.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,<br /> And in a pleasing slumber
      seals his eyes:<br /> Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,<br /> She
      gently bears him to her blissful groves,<br /> Then with a wreath of myrtle
      crowns his head,<br /> And softly lays him on a flow'ry bed.<br /> Cupid
      meantime assum'd his form and face,<br /> Foll'wing Achates with a shorter
      pace,<br /> And brought the gifts. The queen already sate<br /> Amidst the
      Trojan lords, in shining state,<br /> High on a golden bed: her princely
      guest<br /> Was next her side; in order sate the rest.<br /> Then canisters
      with bread are heap'd on high;<br /> Th' attendants water for their hands
      supply,<br /> And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry.<br /> Next fifty
      handmaids in long order bore<br /> The censers, and with fumes the gods
      adore:<br /> Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join<br /> To place the
      dishes, and to serve the wine.<br /> The Tyrian train, admitted to the
      feast,<br /> Approach, and on the painted couches rest.<br /> All on the
      Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,<br /> But view the beauteous boy with more
      amaze,<br /> His rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes,<br /> His motions,
      voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise;<br /> Nor pass unprais'd the
      vest and veil divine,<br /> Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs
      entwine.<br /> But, far above the rest, the royal dame,<br /> (Already
      doom'd to love's disastrous flame,)<br /> With eyes insatiate, and
      tumultuous joy,<br /> Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.<br /> The
      guileful god about the hero long,<br /> With children's play, and false
      embraces, hung;<br /> Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms<br />
      With greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.<br /> Unhappy Dido little
      thought what guest,<br /> How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;<br />
      But he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,<br /> Works in the pliant
      bosom of the fair,<br /> And molds her heart anew, and blots her former
      care.<br /> The dead is to the living love resign'd;<br /> And all Aeneas
      enters in her mind.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,<br /> The meat remov'd, and
      ev'ry guest was pleas'd,<br /> The golden bowls with sparkling wine are
      crown'd,<br /> And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.<br /> From
      gilded roofs depending lamps display<br /> Nocturnal beams, that emulate
      the day.<br /> A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,<br /> The queen
      commanded to be crown'd with wine:<br /> The bowl that Belus us'd, and all
      the Tyrian line.<br /> Then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke:<br />
      "O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,<br /> With solemn rites, thy sacred
      name and pow'r;<br /> Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!<br /> So
      may the Trojan and the Tyrian line<br /> In lasting concord from this day
      combine.<br /> Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,<br /> And
      gracious Juno, both be present here!<br /> And you, my lords of Tyre, your
      vows address<br /> To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace."<br /> The
      goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd<br /> (Sprinkling the first
      libations on the ground,)<br /> And rais'd it to her mouth with sober
      grace;<br /> Then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place.<br /> 'T was
      Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul;<br /> He took challenge, and
      embrac'd the bowl,<br /> With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to
      draw,<br /> Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.<br /> The goblet goes
      around: Iopas brought<br /> His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas
      taught:<br /> The various labors of the wand'ring moon,<br /> And whence
      proceed th' eclipses of the sun;<br /> Th' original of men and beasts; and
      whence<br /> The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,<br /> And
      fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence;<br /> What shakes the solid
      earth; what cause delays<br /> The summer nights and shortens winter days.<br />
      With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:<br /> Those peals are
      echo'd by the Trojan throng.<br /> Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd
      the night,<br /> And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;<br />
      Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more;<br /> Then ask'd what arms the
      swarthy Memnon wore,<br /> What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;<br />
      The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,<br /> And fierce Achilles, with
      his matchless force;<br /> At length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,<br />
      To hear the series of the war desir'd.<br /> "Relate at large, my godlike
      guest," she said,<br /> "The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd:<br />
      The fatal issue of so long a war,<br /> Your flight, your wand'rings, and
      your woes, declare;<br /> For, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast,<br />
      Your men have been distress'd, your navy toss'd,<br /> Sev'n times the sun
      has either tropic view'd,<br /> The winter banish'd, and the spring

      iron bowels stuff the dark abode.<br /> In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an
      isle<br /> (While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile)<br /> Renown'd for
      wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,<br /> Where ships expos'd to wind and
      weather lay.<br /> There was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, for Greece<br />
      Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release.<br /> The Trojans, coop'd
      within their walls so long,<br /> Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,<br />
      Like swarming bees, and with delight survey<br /> The camp deserted, where
      the Grecians lay:<br /> The quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd;<br />
      Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;<br /> Here join'd the battles;
      there the navy rode.<br /> Part on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ:<br />
      The pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin Troy.<br /> Thymoetes first ('t is
      doubtful whether hir'd,<br /> Or so the Trojan destiny requir'd)<br /> Mov'd
      that the ramparts might be broken down,<br /> To lodge the monster fabric
      in the town.<br /> But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,<br /> The fatal
      present to the flames designed,<br /> Or to the wat'ry deep; at least to
      bore<br /> The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore.<br /> The giddy
      vulgar, as their fancies guide,<br /> With noise say nothing, and in parts
      divide.<br /> Laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd,<br /> Ran from the
      fort, and cried, from far, aloud:<br /> 'O wretched countrymen! what fury
      reigns?<br /> What more than madness has possess'd your brains?<br /> Think
      you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?<br /> And are Ulysses' arts no
      better known?<br /> This hollow fabric either must inclose,<br /> Within its
      blind recess, our secret foes;<br /> Or 't is an engine rais'd above the
      town,<br /> T' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down.<br /> Somewhat
      is sure design'd, by fraud or force:<br /> Trust not their presents, nor
      admit the horse.'<br /> Thus having said, against the steed he threw<br />
      His forceful spear, which, hissing as flew,<br /> Pierc'd thro' the
      yielding planks of jointed wood,<br /> And trembling in the hollow belly
      stood.<br /> The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound,<br /> And
      groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound<br /> And, had not
      Heav'n the fall of Troy design'd,<br /> Or had not men been fated to be
      blind,<br /> Enough was said and done t'inspire a better mind.<br /> Then
      had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood,<br /> And Ilian tow'rs and
      Priam's empire stood.<br /> Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds
      bring<br /> A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;<br /> Taken to take;
      who made himself their prey,<br /> T' impose on their belief, and Troy
      betray;<br /> Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent<br /> To die undaunted,
      or to circumvent.<br /> About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;<br /> All
      press to see, and some insult the foe.<br /> Now hear how well the Greeks
      their wiles disguis'd;<br /> Behold a nation in a man compris'd.<br />
      Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound;<br /> He star'd, and
      roll'd his haggard eyes around,<br /> Then said: 'Alas! what earth remains,
      what sea<br /> Is open to receive unhappy me?<br /> What fate a wretched
      fugitive attends,<br /> Scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?'<br />
      He said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye:<br /> Our pity kindles, and our
      passions die.<br /> We cheer youth to make his own defense,<br /> And freely
      tell us what he was, and whence:<br /> What news he could impart, we long
      to know,<br /> And what to credit from a captive foe.<br />

      steer;<br /> When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied<br /> Two serpents,
      rank'd abreast, the seas divide,<br /> And smoothly sweep along the
      swelling tide.<br /> Their flaming crests above the waves they show;<br />
      Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;<br /> Their speckled tails
      advance to steer their course,<br /> And on the sounding shore the flying

      Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd;<br /> Their nimble

      that sputter'd flame.<br /> We fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take,<br />
      And to Laocoon and his children make;<br /> And first around the tender
      boys they wind,<br /> Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and
      bodies grind.<br /> The wretched father, running to their aid<br /> With
      pious haste, but vain, they next invade;<br /> Twice round his waist their
      winding volumes roll'd;<br /> And twice about his gasping throat they fold.<br />
      The priest thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide,<br /> And tow'ring o'er
      his head in triumph ride.<br /> With both his hands he labors at the knots;<br />

      admit the steed, that vows be paid<br /> And incense offer'd to th'
      offended maid.<br /> A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;<br />
      Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare<br /> And fasten to the
      horse's feet; the rest<br /> With cables haul along th' unwieldly beast.<br />
      Each on his fellow for assistance calls;<br /> At length the fatal fabric

      th' unhappy hour;<br /> Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree,<br />

      I saw resolv'd in arms to fall,<br /> And that one spirit animated all:<br />
      'Brave souls!' said I,- 'but brave, alas! in vain-<br /> Come, finish what
      our cruel fates ordain.<br /> You see the desp'rate state of our affairs,<br />
      And heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs.<br /> The passive gods
      behold the Greeks defile<br /> Their temples, and abandon to the spoil<br />
      Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire<br /> To save a sinking town,
      involv'd in fire.<br /> Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:<br />
      Despair of life the means of living shows.'<br /> So bold a speech
      incourag'd their desire<br /> Of death, and added fuel to their fire.<br />

      "As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,<br /> Scour thro' the fields, nor
      fear the stormy night-<br /> Their whelps at home expect the promis'd food,<br />
      And long to temper their dry chaps in blood-<br /> So rush'd we forth at
      once; resolv'd to die,<br /> Resolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try.<br />
      We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare<br /> Th' unequal combat in the
      public square:<br /> Night was our friend; our leader was despair.<br />
      What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?<br /> What eyes can weep
      the sorrows and affright?<br /> An ancient and imperial city falls:<br />
      The streets are fill'd with frequent funerals;<br /> Houses and holy
      temples float in blood,<br /> And hostile nations make a common flood.<br />
      Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,<br /> The vanquish'd triumph,
      and the victors mourn.<br /> Ours take new courage from despair and night:<br />
      Confus'd the fortune is, confus'd the fight.<br /> All parts resound with
      tumults, plaints, and fears;<br /> And grisly Death in sundry shapes
      appears.<br /> Androgeos fell among us, with his band,<br /> Who thought us
      Grecians newly come to land.<br /> 'From whence,' said he, 'my friends,
      this long delay?<br /> You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:<br />
      Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;<br /> And you, like truants,
      come too late ashore.'<br /> He said, but soon corrected his mistake,<br />
      Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:<br /> Amaz'd, he would have
      shunn'd th' unequal fight;<br /> But we, more num'rous, intercept his
      flight.<br /> As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,<br /> Has with unwary
      footing press'd a snake;<br /> He starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies<br />
      His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;<br /> So from our arms
      surpris'd Androgeos flies.<br /> In vain; for him and his we compass'd
      round,<br /> Possess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground,<br /> And of
      their lives an easy conquest found.<br /> Thus Fortune on our first
      endeavor smil'd.<br /> Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil'd,<br />
      Swoln with success, and a daring mind,<br /> This new invention fatally
      design'd.<br /> 'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the way,<br />
      'T is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey.<br /> For what has she these
      Grecian arms bestow'd,<br /> But their destruction, and the Trojans' good?<br />
      Then change we shields, and their devices bear:<br /> Let fraud supply the
      want of force in war.<br /> They find us arms.' This said, himself he
      dress'd<br /> In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest,<br /> His painted
      buckler, and his plumy crest.<br /> Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan
      train,<br /> Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.<br /> Mix'd
      with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,<br /> Flatter'd with hopes to glut
      our greedy rage;<br /> Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,<br /> And
      strew with Grecian carcasses the street.<br /> Thus while their straggling
      parties we defeat,<br /> Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;<br />
      And some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear,<br /> Remount the hollow horse,
      and pant in secret there.<br />

      "Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,<br /> Contending for the
      kingdom of the sky,<br /> South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;<br />
      The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:<br /> Then Nereus strikes
      the deep; the billows rise,<br /> And, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute
      the skies.<br /> The troops we squander'd first again appear<br /> From
      several quarters, and enclose the rear.<br /> They first observe, and to
      the rest betray,<br /> Our diff'rent speech; our borrow'd arms survey.<br />
      Oppress'd with odds, we fall; Coroebus first,<br /> At Pallas' altar, by
      Peneleus pierc'd.<br /> Then Ripheus follow'd, in th' unequal fight;<br />
      Just of his word, observant of the right:<br /> Heav'n thought not so.
      Dymas their fate attends,<br /> With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends.<br />
      Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands<br /> Of awful Phoebus, sav'd
      from impious hands.<br /> Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,<br /> What
      I perform'd, and what I suffer'd there;<br /> No sword avoiding in the
      fatal strife,<br /> Expos'd to death, and prodigal of life;<br /> Witness,
      ye heavens! I live not by my fault:<br /> I strove to have deserv'd the
      death I sought.<br /> But, when I could not fight, and would have died,<br />
      Borne off to distance by the growing tide,<br /> Old Iphitus and I were
      hurried thence,<br /> With Pelias wounded, and without defense.<br /> New
      clamors from th' invested palace ring:<br /> We run to die, or disengage
      the king.<br /> So hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose,<br /> While
      ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose<br /> As all the Dardan and
      Argolic race<br /> Had been contracted in that narrow space;<br /> Or as all
      Ilium else were void of fear,<br /> And tumult, war, and slaughter, only
      there.<br /> Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,<br /> Secure
      advancing, to the turrets rose:<br /> Some mount the scaling ladders; some,
      more bold,<br /> Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;<br /> Their
      left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent,<br /> While with their right
      they seize the battlement.<br /> From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans
      throw<br /> Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;<br /> And
      heavy beams and rafters from the sides<br /> (Such arms their last
      necessity provides)<br /> And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,<br />
      The marks of state and ancient royalty.<br /> The guards below, fix'd in
      the pass, attend<br /> The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.<br />
      Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath,<br /> A second time we ran to
      tempt our death,<br /> To clear the palace from the foe, succeed<br /> The
      weary living, and revenge the dead.<br />

      blind gallery,<br /> To the king's closet led: a way well known<br /> To
      Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne,<br /> Thro' which she brought
      Astyanax, unseen,<br /> To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen.<br />
      Thro' this we pass, and mount the tow'r, from whence<br /> With unavailing
      arms the Trojans make defense.<br /> From this the trembling king had oft
      descried<br /> The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.<br /> Beams from
      its lofty height with swords we hew,<br /> Then, wrenching with our hands,
      th' assault renew;<br /> And, where the rafters on the columns meet,<br />
      We push them headlong with our arms and feet.<br /> The lightning flies not
      swifter than the fall,<br /> Nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall:<br />
      Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath<br /> Are piecemeal torn, or
      pounded into death.<br /> Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent;<br />
      We cease not from above, nor they below relent.<br /> Before the gate stood
      Pyrrhus, threat'ning loud,<br /> With glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the
      crowd.<br /> So shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake,<br /> Who slept
      the winter in a thorny brake,<br /> And, casting off his slough when spring
      returns,<br /> Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;<br /> Restor'd
      with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides<br /> Reflect the sun; and rais'd on
      spires he rides;<br /> High o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along,<br />
      And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.<br /> Proud Periphas, and fierce
      Automedon,<br /> His father's charioteer, together run<br /> To force the
      gate; the Scyrian infantry<br /> Rush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage
      free.<br /> Ent'ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;<br /> And
      flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.<br /> Himself, among the foremost,
      deals his blows,<br /> And with his ax repeated strokes bestows<br /> On the
      strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,<br /> Till from the posts the
      brazen hinges fly.<br /> He hews apace; the double bars at length<br />
      Yield to his ax and unresisted strength.<br /> A mighty breach is made: the
      rooms conceal'd<br /> Appear, and all the palace is reveal'd;<br /> The
      halls of audience, and of public state,<br /> And where the lonely queen in
      secret sate.<br /> Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,<br />
      With not a door, and scarce a space, between.<br /> The house is fill'd
      with loud laments and cries,<br /> And shrieks of women rend the vaulted
      skies;<br /> The fearful matrons run from place to place,<br /> And kiss the
      thresholds, and the posts embrace.<br /> The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus
      plies,<br /> And all his father sparkles in his eyes;<br /> Nor bars, nor
      fighting guards, his force sustain:<br /> The bars are broken, and the
      guards are slain.<br /> In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill;<br />
      Those few defendants whom they find, they kill.<br /> Not with so fierce a
      rage the foaming flood<br /> Roars, when he finds his rapid course
      withstood;<br /> Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,<br /> And sweeps
      the cattle and the cots away.<br /> These eyes beheld him when he march'd
      between<br /> The brother kings: I saw th' unhappy queen,<br /> The hundred
      wives, and where old Priam stood,<br /> To stain his hallow'd altar with
      his brood.<br /> The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,<br /> So large a
      promise, of a progeny),<br /> The posts, of plated gold, and hung with
      spoils,<br /> Fell the reward of the proud victor's toils.<br /> Where'er
      the raging fire had left a space,<br /> The Grecians enter and possess the
      place.<br />

      "Perhaps you may of Priam's fate enquire.<br /> He, when he saw his regal
      town on fire,<br /> His ruin'd palace, and his ent'ring foes,<br /> On ev'ry
      side inevitable woes,<br /> In arms, disus'd, invests his limbs, decay'd,<br />
      Like them, with age; a late and useless aid.<br /> His feeble shoulders
      scarce the weight sustain;<br /> Loaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with
      pain,<br /> Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!<br /> Uncover'd
      but by heav'n, there stood in view<br /> An altar; near the hearth a laurel
      grew,<br /> Dodder'd with age, whose boughs encompass round<br /> The
      household gods, and shade the holy ground.<br /> Here Hecuba, with all her
      helpless train<br /> Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.<br />
      Driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky,<br /> Their images they hug,
      and to their altars fly.<br /> The Queen, when she beheld her trembling
      lord,<br /> And hanging by his side a heavy sword,<br /> 'What rage,' she
      cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's mind?<br /> What arms are these, and to
      what use design'd?<br /> These times want other aids! Were Hector here,<br />
      Ev'n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear.<br /> With us, one
      common shelter thou shalt find,<br /> Or in one common fate with us be
      join'd.'<br /> She said, and with a last salute embrac'd<br /> The poor old
      man, and by the laurel plac'd.<br /> Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons,<br />
      Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.<br /> Thro' swords and foes,
      amaz'd and hurt, he flies<br /> Thro' empty courts and open galleries.<br />
      Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,<br /> And often reaches, and
      his thrusts renews.<br /> The youth, transfix'd, with lamentable cries,<br />
      Expires before his wretched parent's eyes:<br /> Whom gasping at his feet
      when Priam saw,<br /> The fear of death gave place to nature's law;<br />
      And, shaking more with anger than with age,<br /> 'The gods,' said he,
      'requite thy brutal rage!<br /> As sure they will, barbarian, sure they
      must,<br /> If there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just-<br /> Who tak'st
      in wrongs an insolent delight;<br /> With a son's death t' infect a
      father's sight.<br /> Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire<br /> To
      call thee his- not he, thy vaunted sire,<br /> Thus us'd my wretched age:
      the gods he fear'd,<br /> The laws of nature and of nations heard.<br /> He
      cheer'd my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,<br /> The bloodless carcass of
      my Hector sold;<br /> Pitied the woes a parent underwent,<br /> And sent me
      back in safety from his tent.'<br />

      "This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,<br /> Which, flutt'ring,

    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me to fate,<br /> And to my father my

      Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire,<br /> (The mingled paste
      his murder'd son had made,)<br /> Haul'd from beneath the violated shade,<br />
      And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.<br /> His right hand held his
      bloody falchion bare,<br /> His left he twisted in his hoary hair;<br />
      Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:<br /> The lukewarm blood
      came rushing thro' the wound,<br /> And sanguine streams distain'd the
      sacred ground.<br /> Thus Priam fell, and shar'd one common fate<br /> With
      Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state:<br /> He, who the scepter of all Asia
      sway'd,<br /> Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd.<br /> On the bleak
      shore now lies th' abandon'd king,<br /> A headless carcass, and a nameless

      "Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood<br /> Congeal with fear, my
      hair with horror stood:<br /> My father's image fill'd my pious mind,<br />
      Lest equal years might equal fortune find.<br /> Again I thought on my
      forsaken wife,<br /> And trembled for my son's abandon'd life.<br /> I
      look'd about, but found myself alone,<br /> Deserted at my need! My friends
      were gone.<br /> Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd,<br />
      Leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest.<br /> Thus,
      wand'ring in my way, without a guide,<br /> The graceless Helen in the
      porch I spied<br /> Of Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone;<br /> Muffled
      she sate, and, what she could, unknown:<br /> But, by the flames that cast
      their blaze around,<br /> That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.<br />
      For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;<br /> More dreads the
      vengeance of her injur'd lord;<br /> Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her
      abhorr'd.<br /> Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,<br /> Resolv'd
      to give her guilt the due reward:<br /> 'Shall she triumphant sail before
      the wind,<br /> And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?<br /> Shall she her
      kingdom and her friends review,<br /> In state attended with a captive
      crew,<br /> While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls,<br /> And Grecian
      fires consume the Trojan walls?<br /> For this the Phrygian fields and
      Xanthian flood<br /> Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood?<br />
      'T is true, a soldier can small honor gain,<br /> And boast no conquest,
      from a woman slain:<br /> Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,<br />
      Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;<br /> The punish'd crime shall set
      my soul at ease,<br /> And murm'ring manes of my friends appease.'<br />
      Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light<br /> Spread o'er the place;
      and, shining heav'nly bright,<br /> My mother stood reveal'd before my
      sight<br /> Never so radiant did her eyes appear;<br /> Not her own star
      confess'd a light so clear:<br /> Great in her charms, as when on gods
      above<br /> She looks, and breathes herself into their love.<br /> She held
      my hand, the destin'd blow to break;<br /> Then from her rosy lips began to
      speak:<br /> 'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect<br /> Of my
      commands, and those whom I protect?<br /> Why this unmanly rage? Recall to
      mind<br /> Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.<br /> Look if your
      helpless father yet survive,<br /> Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.<br />
      Around your house the greedy Grecians err;<br /> And these had perish'd in
      the nightly war,<br /> But for my presence and protecting care.<br /> Not
      Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault;<br /> But by the gods was this
      destruction brought.<br /> Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve<br />
      The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,<br /> Purge from your sight
      the dross, and make you see<br /> The shape of each avenging deity.<br />
      Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,<br /> Nor fear obedience to your
      mother's will.<br /> Where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies,<br /> Stones
      rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise-<br /> Amid that smother
      Neptune holds his place,<br /> Below the wall's foundation drives his mace,<br />
      And heaves the building from the solid base.<br /> Look where, in arms,
      imperial Juno stands<br /> Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,<br />
      Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.<br /> See! Pallas, of her snaky
      buckler proud,<br /> Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud:<br />
      See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,<br /> And arms against the town
      the partial deities.<br /> Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end:<br />
      Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:<br /> Haste; and a
      mother's care your passage shall befriend.'<br /> She said, and swiftly
      vanish'd from my sight,<br /> Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.<br />
      I look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear;<br /> And the dire forms of
      hostile gods appear.<br /> Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent),<br />
      And Ilium from its old foundations rent;<br /> Rent like a mountain ash,
      which dar'd the winds,<br /> And stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring
      hinds.<br /> About the roots the cruel ax resounds;<br /> The stumps are
      pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds:<br /> The war is felt on high; the
      nodding crown<br /> Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down.<br />
      To their united force it yields, tho' late,<br /> And mourns with mortal
      groans th' approaching fate:<br /> The roots no more their upper load
      sustain;<br /> But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain.<br />

      convey<br /> Thro' foes and fires, to see my house a prey?<br /> Shall I my
      father, wife, and son behold,<br /> Welt'ring in blood, each other's arms
      infold?<br /> Haste! gird my sword, tho' spent and overcome:<br /> 'T is the
      last summons to receive our doom.<br /> I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy
      call!<br /> Not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall.<br /> Restore me to
      the yet unfinish'd fight:<br /> My death is wanting to conclude the night.'<br />
      Arm'd once again, my glitt'ring sword I wield,<br /> While th' other hand
      sustains my weighty shield,<br /> And forth I rush to seek th' abandon'd
      field.<br /> I went; but sad Creusa stopp'd my way,<br /> And cross the
      threshold in my passage lay,<br /> Embrac'd my knees, and, when I would
      have gone,<br /> Shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son:<br /> 'If death be
      your design, at least,' said she,<br /> 'Take us along to share your
      destiny.<br /> If any farther hopes in arms remain,<br /> This place, these
      pledges of your love, maintain.<br /> To whom do you expose your father's
      life,<br /> Your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!'<br /> While thus
      she fills the house with clam'rous cries,<br /> Our hearing is diverted by
      our eyes:<br /> For, while I held my son, in the short space<br /> Betwixt
      our kisses and our last embrace;<br /> Strange to relate, from young Iulus'
      head<br /> A lambent flame arose, which gently spread<br /> Around his
      brows, and on his temples fed.<br /> Amaz'd, with running water we prepare<br />
      To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;<br /> But old Anchises,
      vers'd in omens, rear'd<br /> His hands to heav'n, and this request
      preferr'd:<br /> 'If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend<br /> Thy will; if
      piety can pray'rs commend,<br /> Confirm the glad presage which thou art
      pleas'd to send.'<br /> Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear<br />
      A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:<br /> There shot a streaming lamp
      along the sky,<br /> Which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly;<br /> From
      o'er the roof the blaze began to move,<br /> And, trailing, vanish'd in th'
      Idaean grove.<br /> It swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide,<br /> Then
      in a steaming stench of sulphur died.<br />

      "The good old man with suppliant hands implor'd<br /> The gods' protection,

      I yield, I follow where Heav'n shews the way.<br /> Keep, O my country
      gods, our dwelling place,<br /> And guard this relic of the Trojan race,<br />
      This tender child! These omens are your own,<br /> And you can yet restore

      death, or one deliv'rance, we will share.<br /> My hand shall lead our
      little son; and you,<br /> My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue.<br />
      Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands:<br /> Without the walls a
      ruin'd temple stands,<br /> To Ceres hallow'd once; a cypress nigh<br />
      Shoots up her venerable head on high,<br /> By long religion kept; there
      bend your feet,<br /> And in divided parties let us meet.<br /> Our country
      gods, the relics, and the bands,<br /> Hold you, my father, in your
      guiltless hands:<br /> In me 't is impious holy things to bear,<br /> Red as
      I am with slaughter, new from war,<br /> Till in some living stream I
      cleanse the guilt<br /> Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.'<br />
      Thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide,<br /> I clothe my shoulders
      with a lion's hide<br /> And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,<br />
      The welcome load of my dear father take;<br /> While on my better hand
      Ascanius hung,<br /> And with unequal paces tripp'd along.<br /> Creusa kept
      behind; by choice we stray<br /> Thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way.<br />
      I, who so bold and dauntless, just before,<br /> The Grecian darts and
      shock of lances bore,<br /> At ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear,<br />
      Not for myself, but for the charge I bear;<br /> Till, near the ruin'd gate
      arriv'd at last,<br /> Secure, and deeming all the danger past,<br /> A
      frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.<br /> My father, looking thro'
      the shades, with fear,<br /> Cried out: 'Haste, haste, my son, the foes are
      nigh;<br /> Their swords and shining armor I descry.'<br /> Some hostile
      god, for some unknown offense,<br /> Had sure bereft my mind of better
      sense;<br /> For, while thro' winding ways I took my flight,<br /> And
      sought the shelter of the gloomy night,<br /> Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to
      tell<br /> If by her fatal destiny she fell,<br /> Or weary sate, or
      wander'd with affright;<br /> But she was lost for ever to my sight.<br /> I
      knew not, or reflected, till I meet<br /> My friends, at Ceres' now
      deserted seat.<br /> We met: not one was wanting; only she<br /> Deceiv'd
      her friends, her son, and wretched me.<br />

      "What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!<br /> Whom did I not, of gods
      or men, accuse!<br /> This was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more<br />
      Than all I felt from ruin'd Troy before.<br /> Stung with my loss, and
      raving with despair,<br /> Abandoning my now forgotten care,<br /> Of
      counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,<br /> My sire, my son, my country
      gods I left.<br /> In shining armor once again I sheathe<br /> My limbs, not
      feeling wounds, nor fearing death.<br /> Then headlong to the burning walls
      I run,<br /> And seek the danger I was forc'd to shun.<br /> I tread my
      former tracks; thro' night explore<br /> Each passage, ev'ry street I
      cross'd before.<br /> All things were full of horror and affright,<br /> And
      dreadful ev'n the silence of the night.<br /> Then to my father's house I
      make repair,<br /> With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.<br />
      Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;<br /> The house was fill'd with
      foes, with flames beset.<br /> Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets
      of fire,<br /> Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire.<br /> From thence
      to Priam's palace I resort,<br /> And search the citadel and desart court.<br />
      Then, unobserv'd, I pass by Juno's church:<br /> A guard of Grecians had
      possess'd the porch;<br /> There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey,<br /> And
      thither all the wealth of Troy convey:<br /> The spoils which they from
      ransack'd houses brought,<br /> And golden bowls from burning altars
      caught,<br /> The tables of the gods, the purple vests,<br /> The people's
      treasure, and the pomp of priests.<br /> A rank of wretched youths, with
      pinion'd hands,<br /> And captive matrons, in long order stands.<br /> Then,
      with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim,<br /> Thro' all the silent street,
      Creusa's name:<br /> Creusa still I call; at length she hears,<br /> And
      sudden thro' the shades of night appears-<br /> Appears, no more Creusa,
      nor my wife,<br /> But a pale specter, larger than the life.<br /> Aghast,
      astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear,<br /> I stood; like bristles rose my
      stiffen'd hair.<br /> Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief<br />
      'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.<br /> Desist, my
      much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain;<br /> You bear no more than what the
      gods ordain.<br /> My fates permit me not from hence to fly;<br /> Nor he,
      the great controller of the sky.<br /> Long wand'ring ways for you the
      pow'rs decree;<br /> On land hard labors, and a length of sea.<br /> Then,
      after many painful years are past,<br /> On Latium's happy shore you shall
      be cast,<br /> Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds<br /> The flow'ry
      meadows, and the feeding folds.<br /> There end your toils; and there your
      fates provide<br /> A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:<br /> There fortune
      shall the Trojan line restore,<br /> And you for lost Creusa weep no more.<br />
      Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,<br /> Th' imperious looks
      of some proud Grecian dame;<br /> Or, stooping to the victor's lust,
      disgrace<br /> My goddess mother, or my royal race.<br /> And now, farewell!
      The parent of the gods<br /> Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:<br />
      I trust our common issue to your care.'<br /> She said, and gliding pass'd
      unseen in air.<br /> I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;<br /> And
      thrice about her neck my arms I flung,<br /> And, thrice deceiv'd, on vain
      embraces hung.<br /> Light as an empty dream at break of day,<br /> Or as a
      blast of wind, she rush'd away.<br />

      together brought,<br /> With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,<br />
      Resolv'd, and willing, under my command,<br /> To run all hazards both of
      sea and land.<br /> The Morn began, from Ida, to display<br /> Her rosy

      "When Heav'n had overturn'd the Trojan state<br /> And Priam's throne, by
      too severe a fate;<br /> When ruin'd Troy became the Grecians' prey,<br />
      And Ilium's lofty tow'rs in ashes lay;<br /> Warn'd by celestial omens, we
      retreat,<br /> To seek in foreign lands a happier seat.<br /> Near old
      Antandros, and at Ida's foot,<br /> The timber of the sacred groves we cut,<br />
      And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find<br /> What place the gods for
      our repose assign'd.<br /> Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly
      spring<br /> Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,<br /> When old
      Anchises summon'd all to sea:<br /> The crew my father and the Fates obey.<br />
      With sighs and tears I leave my native shore,<br /> And empty fields, where
      Ilium stood before.<br /> My sire, my son, our less and greater gods,<br />
      All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      "Against our coast appears a spacious land,<br /> Which once the fierce
      Lycurgus did command,<br /> (Thracia the name- the people bold in war;<br />
      Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,)<br /> A hospitable realm
      while Fate was kind,<br /> With Troy in friendship and religion join'd.<br />
      I land; with luckless omens then adore<br /> Their gods, and draw a line
      along the shore;<br /> I lay the deep foundations of a wall,<br /> And
      Aenos, nam'd from me, the city call.<br /> To Dionaean Venus vows are paid,<br />
      And all the pow'rs that rising labors aid;<br /> A bull on Jove's imperial
      altar laid.<br /> Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;<br /> Sharp
      myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew.<br /> There, while I went to crop
      the sylvan scenes,<br /> And shade our altar with their leafy greens,<br />
      I pull'd a plant- with horror I relate<br /> A prodigy so strange and full
      of fate.<br /> The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound<br /> Black bloody
      drops distill'd upon the ground.<br /> Mute and amaz'd, my hair with terror
      stood;<br /> Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd my blood.<br /> Mann'd
      once again, another plant I try:<br /> That other gush'd with the same
      sanguine dye.<br /> Then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown,<br /> With
      pray'rs and vows the Dryads I atone,<br /> With all the sisters of the
      woods, and most<br /> The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast,<br />
      That they, or he, these omens would avert,<br /> Release our fears, and
      better signs impart.<br /> Clear'd, as I thought, and fully fix'd at length<br />
      To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:<br /> I bent my knees
      against the ground; once more<br /> The violated myrtle ran with gore.<br />
      Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb<br /> Of wounded earth, and
      caverns of the tomb,<br /> A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd<br /> My
      fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:<br /> 'Why dost thou thus my
      buried body rend?<br /> O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!<br />
      Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:<br /> The tears distil not
      from the wounded wood;<br /> But ev'ry drop this living tree contains<br />
      Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins.<br /> O fly from this
      unhospitable shore,<br /> Warn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore!<br /> Here
      loads of lances, in my blood embrued,<br /> Again shoot upward, by my blood
      renew'd.'<br />

      "My falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare<br /> My horror, and in
      bristles rose my hair.<br /> When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent,<br />
      Old Priam, fearful of the war's event,<br /> This hapless Polydore to
      Thracia sent:<br /> Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far<br /> From
      noise and tumults, and destructive war,<br /> Committed to the faithless
      tyrant's care;<br /> Who, when he saw the pow'r of Troy decline,<br />
      Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join;<br /> Broke ev'ry bond of
      nature and of truth,<br /> And murder'd, for his wealth, the royal youth.<br />
      O sacred hunger of pernicious gold!<br /> What bands of faith can impious
      lucre hold?<br /> Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears,<br /> I call
      my father and the Trojan peers;<br /> Relate the prodigies of Heav'n,
      require<br /> What he commands, and their advice desire.<br /> All vote to
      leave that execrable shore,<br /> Polluted with the blood of Polydore;<br />
      But, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare,<br /> Then, to his ghost, a
      tomb and altars rear.<br /> In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,<br />
      With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd,<br /> With eyes dejected,
      and with hair unbound.<br /> Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,<br />

      palace; and, in sign<br /> Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join.<br />
      Then to the temple of the god I went,<br /> And thus, before the shrine, my
      vows present:<br /> 'Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place<br /> To the
      sad relics of the Trojan race;<br /> A seat secure, a region of their own,<br />
      A lasting empire, and a happier town.<br /> Where shall we fix? where shall

      not my pray'rs a doubtful answer find;<br /> But in clear auguries unveil
      thy mind.'<br /> Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground,<br /> The
      laurels, and the lofty hills around;<br /> And from the tripos rush'd a
      bellowing sound.<br /> Prostrate we fell; confess'd the present god,<br />
      Who gave this answer from his dark abode:<br /> 'Undaunted youths, go, seek
      that mother earth<br /> From which your ancestors derive their birth.<br />
      The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race<br /> In her old bosom shall
      again embrace.<br /> Thro' the wide world th' Aeneian house shall reign,<br />
      And children's children shall the crown sustain.'<br /> Thus Phoebus did
      our future fates disclose:<br /> A mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      "All are concern'd to know what place the god<br /> Assign'd, and where
      determin'd our abode.<br /> My father, long revolving in his mind<br /> The
      race and lineage of the Trojan kind,<br /> Thus answer'd their demands: 'Ye
      princes, hear<br /> Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.<br /> The
      fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,<br /> Sacred of old to Jove's
      imperial name,<br /> In the mid ocean lies, with large command,<br /> And on
      its plains a hundred cities stand.<br /> Another Ida rises there, and we<br />
      From thence derive our Trojan ancestry.<br /> From thence, as 't is
      divulg'd by certain fame,<br /> To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came;<br />
      There fix'd, and there the seat of empire chose,<br /> Ere Ilium and the
      Trojan tow'rs arose.<br /> In humble vales they built their soft abodes,<br />
      Till Cybele, the mother of the gods,<br /> With tinkling cymbals charm'd
      th' Idaean woods,<br /> She secret rites and ceremonies taught,<br /> And to
      the yoke the savage lions brought.<br /> Let us the land which Heav'n
      appoints, explore;<br /> Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore.<br />
      If Jove assists the passage of our fleet,<br /> The third propitious dawn
      discovers Crete.'<br /> Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid<br /> On
      smoking altars, to the gods he paid:<br /> A bull, to Neptune an oblation
      due,<br /> Another bull to bright Apollo slew;<br /> A milk-white ewe, the
      western winds to please,<br /> And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.<br />
      Ere this, a flying rumor had been spread<br /> That fierce Idomeneus from
      Crete was fled,<br /> Expell'd and exil'd; that the coast was free<br />
      From foreign or domestic enemy.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea;<br /> By Naxos, fam'd for
      vintage, make our way;<br /> Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight<br />
      Of Paros' isle, with marble quarries white.<br /> We pass the scatter'd
      isles of Cyclades,<br /> That, scarce distinguish'd, seem to stud the seas.<br />
      The shouts of sailors double near the shores;<br /> They stretch their
      canvas, and they ply their oars.<br /> 'All hands aloft! for Crete! for
      Crete!' they cry,<br /> And swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly.<br /> Full
      on the promis'd land at length we bore,<br /> With joy descending on the
      Cretan shore.<br /> With eager haste a rising town I frame,<br /> Which from
      the Trojan Pergamus I name:<br /> The name itself was grateful; I exhort<br />
      To found their houses, and erect a fort.<br /> Our ships are haul'd upon
      the yellow strand;<br /> The youth begin to till the labor'd land;<br /> And
      I myself new marriages promote,<br /> Give laws, and dwellings I divide by
      lot;<br /> When rising vapors choke the wholesome air,<br /> And blasts of
      noisome winds corrupt the year;<br /> The trees devouring caterpillars
      burn;<br /> Parch'd was the grass, and blighted was the corn:<br /> Nor
      'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high,<br /> With pestilential heat

      Again my father bids me seek the shore<br /> Of sacred Delos, and the god

      Now from the sight of land our galleys move,<br /> With only seas around
      and skies above;<br /> When o'er our heads descends a burst of rain,<br />
      And night with sable clouds involves the main;<br /> The ruffling winds the

      Palinurus no distinction found<br /> Betwixt the night and day; such
      darkness reign'd around.<br /> Three starless nights the doubtful navy
      strays,<br /> Without distinction, and three sunless days;<br /> The fourth

      distant clouds;<br /> The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight,<br />
      And curling smoke ascending from their height.<br /> The canvas falls;
      their oars the sailors ply;<br /> From the rude strokes the whirling waters
      fly.<br /> At length I land upon the Strophades,<br /> Safe from the danger

      Monsters more fierce offended Heav'n ne'er sent<br /> From hell's abyss,
      for human punishment:<br /> With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene,<br />
      Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean;<br /> With claws for hands,
      and looks for ever lean.<br />

      of our feast,<br /> And Jove himself, the chief invited guest.<br /> We
      spread the tables on the greensward ground;<br /> We feed with hunger, and
      the bowls go round;<br /> When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry,<br />
      And clatt'ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly;<br /> They snatch the meat,
      defiling all they find,<br /> And, parting, leave a loathsome stench

      dinner, and the beds refit,<br /> Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing
      shade,<br /> Where tufted trees a native arbor made.<br /> Again the holy
      fires on altars burn;<br /> And once again the rav'nous birds return,<br />
      Or from the dark recesses where they lie,<br /> Or from another quarter of

      bucklers arm.<br /> In this new kind of combat all employ<br /> Their utmost
      force, the monsters to destroy.<br /> In vain- the fated skin is proof to
      wounds;<br /> And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.<br /> At
      length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey,<br /> And their stretch'd
      pinions to the skies display.<br /> Yet one remain'd- the messenger of
      Fate:<br /> High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,<br /> And thus her dismal
      errand did relate:<br /> 'What! not contented with our oxen slain,<br />
      Dare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain,<br /> And drive the Harpies
      from their native reign?<br /> Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind<br />
      What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design'd,<br /> And I, the Furies'

      you build,<br /> My curses shall severely be fulfill'd.<br /> Fierce famine
      is your lot for this misdeed,<br /> Reduc'd to grind the plates on which
      you feed.'<br /> She said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew.<br /> Our
      courage fails us, and our fears renew.<br /> Hopeless to win by war, to
      pray'rs we fall,<br /> And on th' offended Harpies humbly call,<br /> And

      peace prefer.<br /> But old Anchises, off'ring sacrifice,<br /> And lifting
      up to heav'n his hands and eyes,<br /> Ador'd the greater gods: 'Avert,'

      you who raging winds and waves appease,<br /> Breathe on our swelling sails
      a prosp'rous wind,<br /> And smooth our passage to the port assign'd!'<br />
      The gentle gales their flagging force renew,<br /> And now the happy harbor
      is in view.<br /> Minerva's temple then salutes our sight,<br /> Plac'd, as
      a landmark, on the mountain's height.<br /> We furl our sails, and turn the
      prows to shore;<br /> The curling waters round the galleys roar.<br /> The
      land lies open to the raging east,<br /> Then, bending like a bow, with
      rocks compress'd,<br /> Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,<br />
      And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.<br /> The port lies hid
      within; on either side<br /> Two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.<br />
      The temple, which aloft we view'd before,<br /> To distance flies, and
      seems to shun the shore.<br /> Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld<br />
      Were four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field.<br /> 'War, war is
      threaten'd from this foreign ground,'<br /> My father cried, 'where warlike
      steeds are found.<br /> Yet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit,<br />
      And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,<br /> Peace may succeed to
      war.' Our way we bend<br /> To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;<br />
      There prostrate to the fierce virago pray,<br /> Whose temple was the
      landmark of our way.<br /> Each with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head,<br />
      And all commands of Helenus obey'd,<br /> And pious rites to Grecian Juno
      paid.<br /> These dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand<br /> To
      sea, forsaking that suspected land.<br />

      "From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view,<br /> For Hercules renown'd, if
      fame be true.<br /> Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands;<br /> Caulonian
      tow'rs, and Scylacaean strands,<br /> For shipwrecks fear'd. Mount Aetna
      thence we spy,<br /> Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.<br />
      Far off we hear the waves with surly sound<br /> Invade the rocks, the
      rocks their groans rebound.<br /> The billows break upon the sounding
      strand,<br /> And roll the rising tide, impure with sand.<br /> Then thus
      Anchises, in experience old:<br /> ''T is that Charybdis which the seer
      foretold,<br /> And those the promis'd rocks! Bear off to sea!'<br /> With
      haste the frighted mariners obey.<br /> First Palinurus to the larboard
      veer'd;<br /> Then all the fleet by his example steer'd.<br /> To heav'n
      aloft on ridgy waves we ride,<br /> Then down to hell descend, when they
      divide;<br /> And thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground,<br /> And
      thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound,<br /> And thrice we saw the
      stars, that stood with dews around.<br /> The flagging winds forsook us,
      with the sun;<br /> And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.<br /> The port
      capacious, and secure from wind,<br /> Is to the foot of thund'ring Aetna
      join'd.<br /> By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;<br /> By turns hot
      embers from her entrails fly,<br /> And flakes of mounting flames, that
      lick the sky.<br /> Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,<br /> And,
      shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down.<br /> Oft liquid lakes of
      burning sulphur flow,<br /> Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.<br />
      Enceladus, they say, transfix'd by Jove,<br /> With blasted limbs came
      tumbling from above;<br /> And, where he fell, th' avenging father drew<br />
      This flaming hill, and on his body threw.<br /> As often as he turns his
      weary sides,<br /> He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.<br />
      In shady woods we pass the tedious night,<br /> Where bellowing sounds and
      groans our souls affright,<br /> Of which no cause is offer'd to the sight;<br />
      For not one star was kindled in the sky,<br /> Nor could the moon her
      borrow'd light supply;<br /> For misty clouds involv'd the firmament,<br />
      The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent.<br />

      pious aid, and pointed to the shore.<br /> We look behind, then view his
      shaggy beard;<br /> His clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his
      limbs<br /> besmear'd;<br /> The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face,<br />
      Appear'd a Greek, and such indeed he was.<br /> He cast on us, from far, a
      frightful view,<br /> Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew;<br />
      Stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began<br /> To stretch his limbs,
      and trembled as he ran.<br /> Soon as approach'd, upon his knees he falls,<br />
      And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:<br /> 'Now, by the pow'rs
      above, and what we share<br /> From Nature's common gift, this vital air,<br />
      O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more;<br /> But bear me far from this
      unhappy shore.<br /> 'T is true, I am a Greek, and farther own,<br /> Among
      your foes besieg'd th' imperial town.<br /> For such demerits if my death
      be due,<br /> No more for this abandon'd life I sue;<br /> This only favor
      let my tears obtain,<br /> To throw me headlong in the rapid main:<br />
      Since nothing more than death my crime demands,<br /> I die content, to die
      by human hands.'<br /> He said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd:<br /> I
      bade him boldly tell his fortune past,<br /> His present state, his
      lineage, and his name,<br /> Th' occasion of his fears, and whence he came.<br />
      The good Anchises rais'd him with his hand;<br /> Who, thus encourag'd,
      answer'd our demand:<br /> 'From Ithaca, my native soil, I came<br /> To
      Troy; and Achaemenides my name.<br /> Me my poor father with Ulysses sent;<br />
      (O had I stay'd, with poverty content!)<br /> But, fearful for themselves,
      my countrymen<br /> Left me forsaken in the Cyclops' den.<br /> The cave,
      tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor<br /> Was pav'd with mangled limbs
      and putrid gore.<br /> Our monstrous host, of more than human size,<br />
      Erects his head, and stares within the skies;<br /> Bellowing his voice,
      and horrid is his hue.<br /> Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view!<br />
      The joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food;<br /> And for his wine he
      quaffs the streaming blood.<br /> These eyes beheld, when with his spacious
      hand<br /> He seiz'd two captives of our Grecian band;<br /> Stretch'd on
      his back, he dash'd against the stones<br /> Their broken bodies, and their
      crackling bones:<br /> With spouting blood the purple pavement swims,<br />
      While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs.<br />

      from his maw<br /> His indigested foam, and morsels raw;<br /> We pray; we
      cast the lots, and then surround<br /> The monstrous body, stretch'd along
      the ground:<br /> Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand<br /> To bore
      his eyeball with a flaming brand.<br /> Beneath his frowning forehead lay
      his eye;<br /> For only one did the vast frame supply-<br /> But that a
      globe so large, his front it fill'd,<br /> Like the sun's disk or like a
      Grecian shield.<br /> The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends:<br />
      This vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends.<br /> But haste,
      unhappy wretches, haste to fly!<br /> Your cables cut, and on your oars
      rely!<br /> Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,<br /> A hundred more

      him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep<br /> And now
      three moons their sharpen'd horns renew,<br /> Since thus, in woods and
      wilds, obscure from view,<br /> I drag my loathsome days with mortal
      fright,<br /> And in deserted caverns lodge by night;<br /> Oft from the
      rocks a dreadful prospect see<br /> Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking
      tree:<br /> From far I hear his thund'ring voice resound,<br /> And
      trampling feet that shake the solid ground.<br /> Cornels and salvage
      berries of the wood,<br /> And roots and herbs, have been my meager food.<br />
      While all around my longing eyes I cast,<br /> I saw your happy ships
      appear at last.<br /> On those I fix'd my hopes, to these I run;<br /> 'T is

      He strided onward, and in vain essay'd<br /> Th' Ionian deep, and durst no

      winding caverns echo to the sound.<br /> His brother Cyclops hear the
      yelling roar,<br /> And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore.<br />
      We saw their stern distorted looks, from far,<br /> And one-eyed glance,
      that vainly threaten'd war:<br /> A dreadful council, with their heads on
      high;<br /> (The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;)<br /> Not yielding

      majestic air,<br /> A man descended from the gods declare.<br /> Fear ever
      argues a degenerate kind;<br /> His birth is well asserted by his mind.<br />

      for falling Troy he made!<br /> Such were his looks, so gracefully he
      spoke,<br /> That, were I not resolv'd against the yoke<br /> Of hapless
      marriage, never to be curst<br /> With second love, so fatal was my first,<br />

      sparkles of my former flame.<br /> But first let yawning earth a passage
      rend,<br /> And let me thro' the dark abyss descend;<br /> First let
      avenging Jove, with flames from high,<br /> Drive down this body to the

      more wakeful huntsmen ready wait,<br /> With nets, and toils, and darts,
      beside the force<br /> Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse.<br /> The
      Tyrian peers and officers of state<br /> For the slow queen in antechambers
      wait;<br /> Her lofty courser, in the court below,<br /> Who his majestic
      rider seems to know,<br /> Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,<br />
      And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around.<br /> The queen at
      length appears; on either hand<br /> The brawny guards in martial order
      stand.<br /> A flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,<br /> And at her
      back a golden quiver bore;<br /> Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,<br />
      A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.<br /> Then young Ascanius, with a
      sprightly grace,<br /> Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.<br />
      But far above the rest in beauty shines<br /> The great Aeneas, the troop
      he joins;<br /> Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost<br /> Of wint'ry
      Xanthus, and the Lycian coast,<br /> When to his native Delos he resorts,<br />
      Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;<br /> Where painted Scythians,
      mix'd with Cretan bands,<br /> Before the joyful altars join their hands:<br />
      Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below<br /> The merry madness of the
      sacred show.<br /> Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;<br /> A
      golden fillet binds his awful brows;<br /> His quiver sounds: not less the
      prince is seen<br /> In manly presence, or in lofty mien.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat<br /> Of salvage
      beasts, in dens, their last retreat.<br /> The cry pursues the mountain
      goats: they bound<br /> From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;<br />
      Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,<br /> In herds unsingled,
      scour the dusty plain,<br /> And a long chase in open view maintain.<br />
      The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides,<br /> Spurs thro' the vale, and
      these and those outrides.<br /> His horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to
      feel<br /> The clanking lash, and goring of the steel.<br /> Impatiently he
      views the feeble prey,<br /> Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,<br />
      And rather would the tusky boar attend,<br /> Or see the tawny lion
      downward bend.<br />

      Meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies:<br /> From pole to pole

      to converts ride,<br /> And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow
      side.<br /> The rapid rains, descending from the hills,<br /> To rolling
      torrents raise the creeping rills.<br /> The queen and prince, as love or
      fortune guides,<br /> One common cavern in her bosom hides.<br /> Then first
      the trembling earth the signal gave,<br /> And flashing fires enlighten all
      the cave;<br /> Hell from below, and Juno from above,<br /> And howling
      nymphs, were conscious of their love.<br /> From this ill-omen'd hour in

      Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds<br /> His flying feet, and mounts

      With rapid force they bear him down the skies.<br /> But first he grasps
      within his awful hand<br /> The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand;<br />
      With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;<br /> With this he drives
      them down the Stygian waves;<br /> With this he seals in sleep the wakeful
      sight,<br /> And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light.<br /> Thus
      arm'd, the god begins his airy race,<br /> And drives the racking clouds
      along the liquid space;<br /> Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,<br />
      Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;<br /> Atlas, whose head, with
      piny forests crown'd,<br /> Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors
      bound.<br /> Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin<br /> The
      founts of rolling streams their race begin;<br /> A beard of ice on his

      Then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height<br /> Plung'd downward, with
      precipitated flight,<br /> Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood.<br />
      As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food,<br /> Less, and yet less, to
      distant prospect show;<br /> By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:<br />
      Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,<br /> And near the surface
      of the water flies,<br /> Till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the
      sands,<br /> He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands:<br /> Where
      shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds,<br /> Now tow'rs within the
      clouds advance their heads.<br /> Arriving there, he found the Trojan
      prince<br /> New ramparts raising for the town's defense.<br /> A purple
      scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er,<br /> (Queen Dido's gift,) about his

      Then thus, with winged words, the god began,<br /> Resuming his own shape:

      rising heir:<br /> The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear,<br /> To whom
      th' Ausonian scepter, and the state<br /> Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd
      by fate."<br /> So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,<br />
      Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight.<br />

      The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear;<br /> Mute was his tongue,

      or how should he begin?<br /> What course, alas! remains to steer between<br />
      Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen?<br /> This way and that he turns
      his anxious mind,<br /> And all expedients tries, and none can find.<br />
      Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means,<br /> After long thought, to
      this advice he leans:<br /> Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair<br />

      pretense he bids them find,<br /> To color what in secret he design'd.<br />
      Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose,<br /> Before the
      love-sick lady heard the news;<br /> And move her tender mind, by slow

      the city round.<br /> Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,<br /> When,
      from afar, their nightly god they hear,<br /> And howl about the hills, and
      shake the wreathy spear.<br /> At length she finds the dear perfidious man;<br />
      Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began:<br /> "Base and ungrateful!

      bands of love?<br /> Or is the death of a despairing queen<br /> Not worth
      preventing, tho' too well foreseen?<br /> Ev'n when the wintry winds
      command your stay,<br /> You dare the tempests, and defy the sea.<br />
      False as you are, suppose you were not bound<br /> To lands unknown, and
      foreign coasts to sound;<br /> Were Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign,<br />
      Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?<br /> See whom you fly! am
      I the foe you shun?<br /> Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,<br /> By
      this right hand, (since I have nothing more<br /> To challenge, but the
      faith you gave before;)<br /> I beg you by these tears too truly shed,<br />
      By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;<br /> If ever Dido, when you most
      were kind,<br /> Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind;<br /> By
      these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place,<br /> Pity the fortunes of
      a falling race.<br /> For you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate,<br />
      Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state;<br /> For you alone I suffer in
      my fame,<br /> Bereft of honor, and expos'd to shame.<br /> Whom have I now
      to trust, ungrateful guest?<br /> (That only name remains of all the rest!)<br />
      What have I left? or whither can I fly?<br /> Must I attend Pygmalion's
      cruelty,<br /> Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead<br /> A queen that
      proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed?<br /> Had you deferr'd, at least, your
      hasty flight,<br /> And left behind some pledge of our delight,<br /> Some
      babe to bless the mother's mournful sight,<br /> Some young Aeneas, to
      supply your place,<br /> Whose features might express his father's face;<br />
      I should not then complain to live bereft<br /> Of all my husband, or be

      Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes,<br /> By Jove's command;

      Much less pretended to the lawful claim<br /> Of sacred nuptials, or a
      husband's name.<br /> For, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free,<br />
      And not submit my life to fate's decree,<br /> My choice would lead me to

      appear'd:<br /> Waking I saw him, and his message heard.<br /> From Jove he
      came commission'd, heav'nly bright<br /> With radiant beams, and manifest
      to sight<br /> (The sender and the sent I both attest)<br /> These walls he

      faithless are the skies!<br /> Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!<br />

      makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds.<br /> Now Lycian lots, and now the
      Delian god,<br /> Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode,<br /> To warn
      him hence; as if the peaceful state<br /> Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd
      with human fate!<br /> But go! thy flight no longer I detain-<br /> Go seek
      thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main!<br /> Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my
      pious vow,<br /> The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,<br /> Or
      secret sands, shall sepulchers afford<br /> To thy proud vessels, and their
      perjur'd lord.<br /> Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name:<br /> Dido
      shall come in a black sulph'ry flame,<br /> When death has once dissolv'd
      her mortal frame;<br /> Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:<br />
      Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,<br /> Shall haunt thee waking, and

      And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below."<br />

      dang'rous flight delay,<br /> Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea.<br />
      The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more:<br /> Let him pursue the promis'd
      Latian shore.<br /> A short delay is all I ask him now;<br /> A pause of
      grief, an interval from woe,<br /> Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain<br />
      Accustom'd sorrows, and inur'd to pain.<br /> If you in pity grant this one
      request,<br /> My death shall glut the hatred of his breast."<br /> This
      mournful message pious Anna bears,<br /> And seconds with her own her
      sister's tears:<br /> But all her arts are still employ'd in vain;<br />
      Again she comes, and is refus'd again.<br /> His harden'd heart nor pray'rs
      nor threat'nings move;<br /> Fate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to
      love.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      As, when the winds their airy quarrel try,<br /> Justling from ev'ry
      quarter of the sky,<br /> This way and that the mountain oak they bend,<br />
      His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;<br /> With leaves and
      falling mast they spread the ground;<br /> The hollow valleys echo to the
      sound:<br /> Unmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks,<br /> Or, shaken,
      clings more closely to the rocks;<br /> Far as he shoots his tow'ring head
      on high,<br /> So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie.<br /> No less a
      storm the Trojan hero bears;<br /> Thick messages and loud complaints he
      hears,<br /> And bandied words, still beating on his ears.<br /> Sighs,
      groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains;<br /> But the firm purpose of
      his heart remains.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,<br /> Begins at length the light
      of heav'n to hate,<br /> And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,<br />
      To hasten on the death her soul decrees:<br /> Strange to relate! for when,
      before the shrine,<br /> She pours in sacrifice the purple wine,<br /> The
      purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood,<br /> And the white offer'd milk
      converts to mud.<br /> This dire presage, to her alone reveal'd,<br /> From
      all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd.<br /> A marble temple stood within
      the grove,<br /> Sacred to death, and to her murther'd love;<br /> That
      honor'd chapel she had hung around<br /> With snowy fleeces, and with
      garlands crown'd:<br /> Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,<br />
      Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb;<br /> She thought she heard
      him summon her away,<br /> Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay.<br />
      Hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note<br /> The solitary screech owl
      strains her throat,<br /> And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height,<br />
      With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.<br /> Besides, old
      prophecies augment her fears;<br /> And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears,<br />
      Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,<br /> To wander in her sleep, thro'
      ways unknown,<br /> Guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain,<br /> To seek
      her subjects, and to seek in vain:<br /> Like Pentheus, when, distracted
      with his fear,<br /> He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;<br /> Or
      mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost<br /> Full in his face infernal
      torches toss'd,<br /> And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight,<br />
      Flies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright;<br /> The Furies guard
      the door and intercept his flight.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,<br /> From death alone she seeks
      her last relief;<br /> The time and means resolv'd within her breast,<br />
      She to her mournful sister thus address'd<br /> (Dissembling hope, her
      cloudy front she clears,<br /> And a false vigor in her eyes appears):<br />
      "Rejoice!" she said. "Instructed from above,<br /> My lover I shall gain,
      or lose my love.<br /> Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,<br /> Long
      tracts of Ethiopian climates run:<br /> There a Massylian priestess I have
      found,<br /> Honor'd for age, for magic arts renown'd:<br /> Th' Hesperian
      temple was her trusted care;<br /> 'T was she supplied the wakeful dragon's
      fare.<br /> She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep,<br /> Reclaim'd his
      rage, and sooth'd him into sleep.<br /> She watch'd the golden fruit; her
      charms unbind<br /> The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:<br /> She
      stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,<br /> Repels the stars, and
      backward bears the sky.<br /> The yawning earth rebellows to her call,<br />
      Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.<br /> Witness, ye gods, and
      thou my better part,<br /> How loth I am to try this impious art!<br />
      Within the secret court, with silent care,<br /> Erect a lofty pile,
      expos'd in air:<br /> Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest,<br />
      Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest.<br /> Next, under these,
      the bridal bed be plac'd,<br /> Where I my ruin in his arms embrac'd:<br />
      All relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire;<br /> For so the priestess and
      her charms require."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;<br /> A mortal paleness in
      her face appears:<br /> Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find<br /> The
      secret fun'ral in these rites design'd;<br /> Nor thought so dire a rage
      possess'd her mind.<br /> Unknowing of a train conceal'd so well,<br /> She
      fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell;<br /> Therefore obeys. The fatal
      pile they rear,<br /> Within the secret court, expos'd in air.<br /> The
      cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high,<br /> And garlands on the hollow
      spaces lie.<br /> Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath,<br /> And
      ev'ry baleful green denoting death.<br /> The queen, determin'd to the
      fatal deed,<br /> The spoils and sword he left, in order spread,<br /> And
      the man's image on the nuptial bed.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      And now (the sacred altars plac'd around)<br /> The priestess enters, with
      her hair unbound,<br /> And thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground.<br />
      Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims,<br /> And threefold Hecate, with
      her hundred names,<br /> And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round<br />
      With feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd ground;<br /> Culls hoary simples,
      found by Phoebe's light,<br /> With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night;<br />
      Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl,<br /> And cuts the forehead of a
      newborn foal,<br /> Robbing the mother's love. The destin'd queen<br />
      Observes, assisting at the rites obscene;<br /> A leaven'd cake in her
      devoted hands<br /> She holds, and next the highest altar stands:<br /> One
      tender foot was shod, her other bare;<br /> Girt was her gather'd gown, and
      loose her hair.<br /> Thus dress'd, she summon'd, with her dying breath,<br />
      The heav'ns and planets conscious of her death,<br /> And ev'ry pow'r, if
      any rules above,<br /> Who minds, or who revenges, injur'd love.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "'T was dead of night, when weary bodies close<br /> Their eyes in balmy
      sleep and soft repose:<br /> The winds no longer whisper thro' the woods,<br />
      Nor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods.<br /> The stars in silent
      order mov'd around;<br /> And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the
      ground<br /> The flocks and herds, and party-color'd fowl,<br /> Which haunt
      the woods, or swim the weedy pool,<br /> Stretch'd on the quiet earth,
      securely lay,<br /> Forgetting the past labors of the day.<br /> All else of
      nature's common gift partake:<br /> Unhappy Dido was alone awake.<br /> Nor
      sleep nor ease the furious queen can find;<br /> Sleep fled her eyes, as
      quiet fled her mind.<br /> Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;<br />
      Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then thus she said within her secret mind:<br /> "What shall I do? what
      succor can I find?<br /> Become a suppliant to Hyarba's pride,<br /> And
      take my turn, to court and be denied?<br /> Shall I with this ungrateful
      Trojan go,<br /> Forsake an empire, and attend a foe?<br /> Himself I
      refug'd, and his train reliev'd-<br /> 'T is true- but am I sure to be
      receiv'd?<br /> Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place!<br /> Laomedon
      still lives in all his race!<br /> Then, shall I seek alone the churlish
      crew,<br /> Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?<br /> What force
      have I but those whom scarce before<br /> I drew reluctant from their
      native shore?<br /> Will they again embark at my desire,<br /> Once more
      sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre?<br /> Rather with steel thy
      guilty breast invade,<br /> And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.<br />
      Your pity, sister, first seduc'd my mind,<br /> Or seconded too well what I
      design'd.<br /> These dear-bought pleasures had I never known,<br /> Had I
      continued free, and still my own;<br /> Avoiding love, I had not found
      despair,<br /> But shar'd with salvage beasts the common air.<br /> Like
      them, a lonely life I might have led,<br /> Not mourn'd the living, nor
      disturb'd the dead."<br /> These thoughts she brooded in her anxious
      breast.<br /> On board, the Trojan found more easy rest.<br /> Resolv'd to
      sail, in sleep he pass'd the night;<br /> And order'd all things for his
      early flight.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      To whom once more the winged god appears;<br /> His former youthful mien
      and shape he wears,<br /> And with this new alarm invades his ears:<br />
      "Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown<br /> Thy needful
      cares, so near a hostile town,<br /> Beset with foes; nor hear'st the
      western gales<br /> Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails?<br /> She
      harbors in her heart a furious hate,<br /> And thou shalt find the dire
      effects too late;<br /> Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die.<br /> Haste
      swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly.<br /> The sea with ships will
      soon be cover'd o'er,<br /> And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore.<br />
      Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,<br /> And sail before the
      purple morn arise.<br /> Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?<br />
      Woman's a various and a changeful thing."<br /> Thus Hermes in the dream;
      then took his flight<br /> Aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Twice warn'd by the celestial messenger,<br /> The pious prince arose with
      hasty fear;<br /> Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay:<br /> "Haste
      to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh,<br /> And spread your flying
      sails, and stand to sea.<br /> A god commands: he stood before my sight,<br />
      And urg'd us once again to speedy flight.<br /> O sacred pow'r, what pow'r
      soe'er thou art,<br /> To thy blest orders I resign my heart.<br /> Lead
      thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,<br /> And prosper the design thy
      will commands."<br /> He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword,<br />
      His thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord.<br /> An emulating zeal
      inspires his train:<br /> They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.<br />
      With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,<br /> And brush the
      liquid seas with lab'ring oars.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Aurora now had left her saffron bed,<br /> And beams of early light the
      heav'ns o'erspread,<br /> When, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,<br />
      Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.<br /> She look'd to seaward; but
      the sea was void,<br /> And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.<br />
      Stung with despite, and furious with despair,<br /> She struck her
      trembling breast, and tore her hair.<br /> "And shall th' ungrateful
      traitor go," she said,<br /> "My land forsaken, and my love betray'd?<br />
      Shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street,<br /> To follow, sink, and
      burn his perjur'd fleet?<br /> Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!<br />
      Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!<br /> What have I said?
      where am I? Fury turns<br /> My brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns.<br />
      Then, when I gave my person and my throne,<br /> This hate, this rage, had
      been more timely shown.<br /> See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name,<br />
      The pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame,<br /> Preserv'd his gods, and
      to the Phrygian shore<br /> The burthen of his feeble father bore!<br /> I
      should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods<br /> His scatter'd
      limbs, or left expos'd in woods;<br /> Destroy'd his friends and son; and,
      from the fire,<br /> Have set the reeking boy before the sire.<br /> Events
      are doubtful, which on battles wait:<br /> Yet where's the doubt, to souls
      secure of fate?<br /> My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command,<br />
      Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band;<br /> At once extinguish'd all
      the faithless name;<br /> And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,<br /> Had
      fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame.<br /> Thou Sun, who
      view'st at once the world below;<br /> Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial
      vow;<br /> Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!<br /> Ye Furies,
      fiends, and violated gods,<br /> All pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying
      breath,<br /> Attend her curses and avenge her death!<br /> If so the Fates
      ordain, Jove commands,<br /> Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian
      lands,<br /> Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes,<br /> His peaceful
      entrance with dire arms oppose:<br /> Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal
      field,<br /> His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd,<br /> Let him for
      succor sue from place to place,<br /> Torn from his subjects, and his son's
      embrace.<br /> First, let him see his friends in battle slain,<br /> And
      their untimely fate lament in vain;<br /> And when, at length, the cruel
      war shall cease,<br /> On hard conditions may he buy his peace:<br /> Nor
      let him then enjoy supreme command;<br /> But fall, untimely, by some
      hostile hand,<br /> And lie unburied on the barren sand!<br /> These are my
      pray'rs, and this my dying will;<br /> And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse
      fulfil.<br /> Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,<br /> Against the
      prince, the people, and the name.<br /> These grateful off'rings on my
      grave bestow;<br /> Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!<br />
      Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age,<br /> When rage excites your
      arms, and strength supplies the rage<br /> Rise some avenger of our Libyan
      blood,<br /> With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood;<br /> Our arms,
      our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs;<br /> And the same hate descend on
      all our heirs!"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      This said, within her anxious mind she weighs<br /> The means of cutting
      short her odious days.<br /> Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said<br />
      (For, when she left her country, hers was dead):<br /> "Go, Barce, call my
      sister. Let her care<br /> The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;<br /> The
      sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring,<br /> Sprinkling her body from
      the crystal spring<br /> With living drops; then let her come, and thou<br />
      With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.<br /> Thus will I pay my vows to
      Stygian Jove,<br /> And end the cares of my disastrous love;<br /> Then cast
      the Trojan image on the fire,<br /> And, as that burns, my passions shall
      expire."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The nurse moves onward, with officious care,<br /> And all the speed her
      aged limbs can bear.<br /> But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd,<br />
      Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd.<br /> With livid spots
      distinguish'd was her face;<br /> Red were her rolling eyes, and
      discompos'd her pace;<br /> Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her
      breath,<br /> And nature shiver'd at approaching death.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd,<br /> And mounts the fun'ral
      pile with furious haste;<br /> Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind<br />
      (Not for so dire an enterprise design'd).<br /> But when she view'd the
      garments loosely spread,<br /> Which once he wore, and saw the conscious
      bed,<br /> She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd;<br /> Then on the
      couch her trembling body cast,<br /> Repress'd the ready tears, and spoke
      her last:<br /> "Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd,<br />
      Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd:<br /> My fatal course is finish'd;
      and I go,<br /> A glorious name, among the ghosts below.<br /> A lofty city
      by my hands is rais'd,<br /> Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd.<br />
      What could my fortune have afforded more,<br /> Had the false Trojan never
      touch'd my shore!"<br /> Then kiss'd the couch; and, "Must I die," she
      said,<br /> "And unreveng'd? 'T is doubly to be dead!<br /> Yet ev'n this
      death with pleasure I receive:<br /> On any terms, 't is better than to
      live.<br /> These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;<br /> These
      boding omens his base flight pursue!"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      She said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side<br /> The piercing steel,
      with reeking purple dyed:<br /> Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon
      stands;<br /> The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.<br /> Her sad
      attendants saw the deadly stroke,<br /> And with loud cries the sounding
      palace shook.<br /> Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,<br /> And
      thro' the town the dismal rumor spread.<br /> First from the frighted court
      the yell began;<br /> Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:<br />
      The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries<br /> Of mixing women,
      mount the vaulted skies.<br /> Not less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre,<br />
      Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire-<br /> The rolling ruin, with
      their lov'd abodes,<br /> Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,<br /> She beats her breast,
      and rends her yellow hair,<br /> And, calling on Eliza's name aloud,<br />
      Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd.<br /> "Was all that
      pomp of woe for this prepar'd;<br /> These fires, this fun'ral pile, these
      altars rear'd?<br /> Was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she,<br />
      "All only to deceive unhappy me?<br /> Which is the worst? Didst thou in
      death pretend<br /> To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?<br /> Thy
      summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come;<br /> One sword had serv'd us
      both, one common tomb:<br /> Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke,<br />
      Not to be present at the fatal stroke?<br /> At once thou hast destroy'd
      thyself and me,<br /> Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!<br /> Bring
      water; bathe the wound; while I in death<br /> Lay close my lips to hers,
      and catch the flying breath."<br /> This said, she mounts the pile with
      eager haste,<br /> And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;<br /> Her
      temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,<br /> To stanch the streaming
      blood, and cleanse the gore.<br /> Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping
      head,<br /> And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;<br /> Thrice
      op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,<br /> But, having found it,
      sicken'd at the sight,<br /> And clos'd her lids at last in endless night.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain<br /> A death so ling'ring, and
      so full of pain,<br /> Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife<br /> Of
      lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life.<br /> For since she died, not
      doom'd by Heav'n's decree,<br /> Or her own crime, but human casualty,<br />
      And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair,<br /> The Sisters had not
      cut the topmost hair,<br /> Which Proserpine and they can only know;<br />
      Nor made her sacred to the shades below.<br /> Downward the various goddess
      took her flight,<br /> And drew a thousand colors from the light;<br /> Then
      stood above the dying lover's head,<br /> And said: "I thus devote thee to
      the dead.<br /> This off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear."<br /> Thus while
      she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:<br /> The struggling soul was loos'd,
      and life dissolv'd in air.<br />

      Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat'ry way,<br /> Fix'd on his voyage, thro'
      the curling sea;<br /> Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze,<br />
      Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze.<br /> The cause unknown; yet
      his presaging mind<br /> The fate of Dido from the fire divin'd;<br /> He
      knew the stormy souls of womankind,<br /> What secret springs their eager
      passions move,<br /> How capable of death for injur'd love.<br /> Dire
      auguries from hence the Trojans draw;<br /> Till neither fires nor shining
      shores they saw.<br /> Now seas and skies their prospect only bound;<br />
      An empty space above, a floating field around.<br /> But soon the heav'ns
      with shadows were o'erspread;<br /> A swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er
      their head:<br /> Livid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm:<br /> Then
      night and horror ocean's face deform.<br /> The pilot, Palinurus, cried
      aloud:<br /> "What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud<br /> My
      thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars,<br /> Stand to your tackle,
      mates, and stretch your oars;<br /> Contract your swelling sails, and luff
      to wind."<br /> The frighted crew perform the task assign'd.<br /> Then, to
      his fearless chief: "Not Heav'n," said he,<br /> "Tho' Jove himself should
      promise Italy,<br /> Can stem the torrent of this raging sea.<br /> Mark how
      the shifting winds from west arise,<br /> And what collected night involves
      the skies!<br /> Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea,<br /> Much less
      against the tempest force their way.<br /> 'T is fate diverts our course,
      and fate we must obey.<br /> Not far from hence, if I observ'd aright<br />
      The southing of the stars, and polar light,<br /> Sicilia lies, whose
      hospitable shores<br /> In safety we may reach with struggling oars."<br />
      Aeneas then replied: "Too sure I find<br /> We strive in vain against the
      seas and wind:<br /> Now shift your sails; what place can please me more<br />
      Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore,<br /> Whose hallow'd earth
      Anchises' bones contains,<br /> And where a prince of Trojan lineage
      reigns?"<br /> The course resolv'd, before the western wind<br /> They scud
      amain, and make the port assign'd.<br /> Meantime Acestes, from a lofty
      stand,<br /> Beheld the fleet descending on the land;<br /> And, not
      unmindful of his ancient race,<br /> Down from the cliff he ran with eager
      pace,<br /> And held the hero in a strict embrace.<br /> Of a rough Libyan
      bear the spoils he wore,<br /> And either hand a pointed jav'lin bore.<br />
      His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;<br /> His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian
      flood.<br /> He welcomes his returning friends ashore<br /> With plenteous
      country cates and homely store.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Now, when the following morn had chas'd away<br /> The flying stars, and
      light restor'd the day,<br /> Aeneas call'd the Trojan troops around,<br />
      And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:<br /> "Offspring of heav'n,
      divine Dardanian race!<br /> The sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space,<br />
      The shining circle of the year has fill'd,<br /> Since first this isle my
      father's ashes held:<br /> And now the rising day renews the year;<br /> A
      day for ever sad, for ever dear.<br /> This would I celebrate with annual
      games,<br /> With gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames,<br /> Tho'
      banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands,<br /> Caught on the Grecian seas, or
      hostile lands:<br /> But since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n<br />
      (Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n)<br /> Upon these friendly
      shores and flow'ry plains,<br /> Which hide Anchises and his blest remains,<br />
      Let us with joy perform his honors due,<br /> And pray for prosp'rous
      winds, our voyage to renew;<br /> Pray, that in towns and temples of our
      own,<br /> The name of great Anchises may be known,<br /> And yearly games
      may spread the gods' renown.<br /> Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,<br />
      With royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace:<br /> Two steers on ev'ry
      ship the king bestows;<br /> His gods and ours shall share your equal vows.<br />
      Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn<br /> Shall with unclouded
      light the skies adorn,<br /> That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:<br />
      Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race;<br /> Some shall in
      swiftness for the goal contend,<br /> And others try the twanging bow to
      bend;<br /> The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand<br /> Oppos'd
      in combat on the yellow sand.<br /> Let all be present at the games
      prepar'd,<br /> And joyful victors wait the just reward.<br /> But now
      assist the rites, with garlands crown'd."<br /> He said, and first his
      brows with myrtle bound.<br /> Then Helymus, by his example led,<br /> And
      old Acestes, each adorn'd his head;<br /> Thus young Ascanius, with a
      sprightly grace,<br /> His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 0.5em">Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,</span><br />
      By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,<br /> To great Anchises'
      tomb; which when he found,<br /> He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd
      ground,<br /> Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,<br /> And two
      (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore,<br /> With roses then the sepulcher he
      strow'd<br /> And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:<br /> "Hail, O ye
      holy manes! hail again,<br /> Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain!<br />
      The gods permitted not, that you, with me,<br /> Should reach the promis'd
      shores of Italy,<br /> Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."<br />
      Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride,<br /> A serpent from the
      tomb began to glide;<br /> His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd;<br />
      Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold:<br /> Thus
      riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass<br /> A rolling fire along, and
      singe the grass.<br /> More various colors thro' his body run,<br /> Than
      Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.<br /> Betwixt the rising altars, and
      around,<br /> The sacred monster shot along the ground;<br /> With harmless
      play amidst the bowls he pass'd,<br /> And with his lolling tongue assay'd
      the taste:<br /> Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest<br /> Within
      the hollow tomb retir'd to rest.<br /> The pious prince, surpris'd at what
      he view'd,<br /> The fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd,<br /> Doubtful
      if this place's genius were,<br /> Or guardian of his father's sepulcher.<br />
      Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;<br /> As many swine, and
      steers of sable hue;<br /> New gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd.<br />
      And call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd.<br /> The glad
      attendants in long order come,<br /> Off'ring their gifts at great
      Anchises' tomb:<br /> Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;<br /> Some
      place the chargers on the grassy soil;<br /> Some blow the fires, and
      offered entrails broil.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright<br /> With rosy luster of
      the rising light:<br /> The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame<br />
      Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name,<br /> The crowded shore with
      acclamations fill,<br /> Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.<br />
      And first the gifts in public view they place,<br /> Green laurel wreaths,
      and palm, the victors' grace:<br /> Within the circle, arms and tripods
      lie,<br /> Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high,<br /> And vests
      embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye.<br /> The trumpet's clangor then the feast
      proclaims,<br /> And all prepare for their appointed games.<br /> Four
      galleys first, which equal rowers bear,<br /> Advancing, in the wat'ry
      lists appear.<br /> The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind,<br /> Bore
      Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:<br /> Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk
      commands,<br /> Which rising, like a tow'ring city stands;<br /> Three
      Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar;<br /> Three banks in three degrees the
      sailors bore;<br /> Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.<br />
      Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race,<br /> In the great Centaur took the
      leading place;<br /> Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,<br /> From
      whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Far in the sea, against the foaming shore,<br /> There stands a rock: the
      raging billows roar<br /> Above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear,<br />
      Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.<br /> In peace below the
      gentle waters run;<br /> The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.<br />
      On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight,<br /> The mark to guide the
      mariners aright.<br /> To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;<br />
      Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.<br /> The lots
      decide their place. Above the rest,<br /> Each leader shining in his Tyrian
      vest;<br /> The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs<br /> Their
      temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:<br /> Besmear'd with oil,
      their naked shoulders shine.<br /> All take their seats, and wait the
      sounding sign:<br /> They gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast<br />
      Is rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress'd.<br /> The
      clangor of the trumpet gives the sign;<br /> At once they start, advancing
      in a line:<br /> With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;<br /> Lash'd
      with their oars, the smoky billows rise;<br /> Sparkles the briny main, and
      the vex'd ocean fries.<br /> Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:<br />
      At once the brushing oars and brazen prow<br /> Dash up the sandy waves,
      and ope the depths below.<br /> Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,<br />
      Invade the field with half so swift a pace;<br /> Not the fierce driver
      with more fury lends<br /> The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,<br />
      Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.<br /> The partial crowd their
      hopes and fears divide,<br /> And aid with eager shouts the favor'd side.<br />
      Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound,<br /> From woods to woods,
      from hills to hills rebound.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,<br /> Gyas outstripp'd the rest,
      and sprung before:<br /> Cloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast,<br />
      But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste.<br /> The Centaur and the
      Dolphin brush the brine<br /> With equal oars, advancing in a line;<br />
      And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,<br /> And now the speedy Dolphin
      gets ahead;<br /> Now board to board the rival vessels row,<br /> The
      billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.<br /> They reach'd the
      mark. Proud Gyas and his train<br /> In triumph rode, the victors of the
      main;<br /> But, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand<br /> More close
      to shore, and skim along the sand-<br /> "Let others bear to sea!" Menoetes
      heard;<br /> But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd,<br /> And,
      fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd.<br /> With louder
      cries the captain call'd again:<br /> "Bear to the rocky shore, and shun
      the main."<br /> He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw<br /> The bold
      Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.<br /> Betwixt the mark and him the
      Scylla stood,<br /> And in a closer compass plow'd the flood.<br /> He
      pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before:<br /> Gyas blasphem'd the gods,
      devoutly swore,<br /> Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.<br />
      Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown<br /> His rising rage) and
      careless of his own,<br /> The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;<br />
      Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:<br /> This done, he seiz'd the
      helm; his fellows cheer'd,<br /> Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly
      steer'd.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,<br /> Clogg'd with his clothes,
      and cumber'd with his years:<br /> Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff
      with pain.<br /> The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,<br /> Shout
      from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd,<br /> To see his heaving breast
      disgorge the briny draught.<br /> The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's
      crew,<br /> Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew;<br /> While Gyas lags,
      they kindle in the race,<br /> To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the
      place;<br /> Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,<br /> Comes up,
      not half his galley's length behind;<br /> Then, on the deck, amidst his
      mates appear'd,<br /> And thus their drooping courage he cheer'd:<br /> "My
      friends, and Hector's followers heretofore,<br /> Exert your vigor; tug the
      lab'ring oar;<br /> Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew,<br />
      Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.<br /> In this, our common
      int'rest, let me find<br /> That strength of hand, that courage of the
      mind,<br /> As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood,<br /> And o'er the
      Syrtes' broken billows row'd.<br /> I seek not now the foremost palm to
      gain;<br /> Tho' yet- but, ah! that haughty wish is vain!<br /> Let those
      enjoy it whom the gods ordain.<br /> But to be last, the lags of all the
      race!-<br /> Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace."<br /> Now, one
      and all, they tug amain; they row<br /> At the full stretch, and shake the
      brazen prow.<br /> The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides<br /> Are
      swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides.<br /> Chance aids their
      daring with unhop'd success;<br /> Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press<br />
      Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,<br /> Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur
      in the lock.<br /> The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,<br />
      Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke.<br /> The trembling rowers
      from their banks arise,<br /> And, anxious for themselves, renounce the
      prize.<br /> With iron poles they heave her off the shores,<br /> And gather
      from the sea their floating oars.<br /> The crew of Mnestheus, with elated
      minds,<br /> Urge their success, and call the willing winds;<br /> Then ply
      their oars, and cut their liquid way<br /> In larger compass on the roomy
      sea.<br /> As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,<br /> Rous'd in a
      fright, her sounding wings she shakes;<br /> The cavern rings with
      clatt'ring; out she flies,<br /> And leaves her callow care, and cleaves
      the skies:<br /> At first she flutters; but at length she springs<br /> To
      smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:<br /> So Mnestheus in the
      Dolphin cuts the sea;<br /> And, flying with a force, that force assists
      his way.<br /> Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd,<br /> Wedg'd in the
      rocky shoals, and sticking fast.<br /> In vain the victor he with cries
      implores,<br /> And practices to row with shatter'd oars.<br /> Then
      Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:<br /> The ship, without a pilot,
      yields the prize.<br /> Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains;<br /> Her he
      pursues, and all his vigor strains.<br /> Shouts from the fav'ring
      multitude arise;<br /> Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;<br /> Shouts,
      wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the skies.<br /> These clamors with
      disdain the Scylla heard,<br /> Much grudg'd the praise, but more the
      robb'd reward:<br /> Resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace,<br />
      All obstinate to die, or gain the race.<br /> Rais'd with success, the
      Dolphin swiftly ran;<br /> For they can conquer, who believe they can.<br />
      Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,<br /> And both perhaps had
      shar'd an equal prize;<br /> When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,<br />
      And succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands:<br /> "Gods of the liquid
      realms, on which I row!<br /> If, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow,<br />
      Assist to make me guilty of my vow!<br /> A snow-white bull shall on your
      shore be slain;<br /> His offer'd entrails cast into the main,<br /> And
      ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,<br /> Your grateful gift and my
      return shall own."<br /> The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,<br />
      With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;<br /> And old Portunus, with his
      breadth of hand,<br /> Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land.<br />
      Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,<br /> And, darting to the
      port, obtains the prize.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The herald summons all, and then proclaims<br /> Cloanthus conqu'ror of the
      naval games.<br /> The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head,<br />
      And three fat steers are to his vessel led,<br /> The ship's reward; with
      gen'rous wine beside,<br /> And sums of silver, which the crew divide.<br />
      The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest;<br /> The victor honor'd with
      a nobler vest,<br /> Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,<br /> And
      needlework its happy cost bestows.<br /> There Ganymede is wrought with
      living art,<br /> Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart:<br />
      Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;<br /> When from aloft descends,
      in open view,<br /> The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,<br /> With
      crooked talons bears the boy away.<br /> In vain, with lifted hands and
      gazing eyes,<br /> His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies,<br /> And
      dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Mnestheus the second victor was declar'd;<br /> And, summon'd there, the
      second prize he shard.<br /> A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore,<br /> More
      brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore,<br /> In single combat on the Trojan
      shore:<br /> This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess;<br /> In war for
      his defense, for ornament in peace.<br /> Rich was the gift, and glorious
      to behold,<br /> But yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold,<br /> That
      scarce two servants could the weight sustain;<br /> Yet, loaded thus,
      Demoleus o'er the plain<br /> Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train.<br />
      The third, succeeding to the last reward,<br /> Two goodly bowls of massy
      silver shar'd,<br /> With figures prominent, and richly wrought,<br /> And
      two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands,<br /> Their conqu'ring temples
      bound with purple bands;<br /> And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,<br />
      Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock.<br /> Forlorn she look'd,
      without an aiding oar,<br /> And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore.<br />
      As when a snake, surpris'd upon the road,<br /> Is crush'd athwart her body
      by the load<br /> Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound<br /> Her belly
      bruis'd, and trodden to the ground:<br /> In vain, with loosen'd curls, she
      crawls along;<br /> Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;<br />
      Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;<br /> But, groveling in
      the dust, her parts unsound she trails:<br /> So slowly to the port the
      Centaur tends,<br /> But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.<br />
      Yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince<br /> Is pleas'd th' unhappy
      chief to recompense.<br /> Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,<br />
      Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      From thence his way the Trojan hero bent<br /> Into the neighb'ring plain,
      with mountains pent,<br /> Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.<br />
      Full in the midst of this fair valley stood<br /> A native theater, which,
      rising slow<br /> By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below.<br /> High
      on a sylvan throne the leader sate;<br /> A num'rous train attend in solemn
      state.<br /> Here those that in the rapid course delight,<br /> Desire of
      honor and the prize invite.<br /> The rival runners without order stand;<br />
      The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band.<br /> First Nisus, with Euryalus,
      appears;<br /> Euryalus a boy of blooming years,<br /> With sprightly grace
      and equal beauty crown'd;<br /> Nisus, for friendship to the youth
      renown'd.<br /> Diores next, of Priam's royal race,<br /> Then Salius joined
      with Patron, took their place;<br /> (But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,<br />
      And Salius his from Arcananian earth;)<br /> Then two Sicilian youths- the
      names of these,<br /> Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:<br /> Both jolly
      huntsmen, both in forest bred,<br /> And owning old Acestes for their head;<br />
      With sev'ral others of ignobler name,<br /> Whom time has not deliver'd
      o'er to fame.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd,<br /> In words which gen'ral
      approbation gain'd:<br /> "One common largess is for all design'd,<br />
      (The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,)<br /> Two darts of
      polish'd steel and Gnosian wood,<br /> A silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd.<br />
      The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:<br /> The first of these
      obtains a stately steed,<br /> Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in
      fame,<br /> The quiver of an Amazonian dame,<br /> With feather'd Thracian
      arrows well supplied:<br /> A golden belt shall gird his manly side,<br />
      Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.<br /> The third this Grecian
      helmet shall content."<br /> He said. To their appointed base they went;<br />
      With beating hearts th' expected sign receive,<br /> And, starting all at
      once, the barrier leave.<br /> Spread out, as on the winged winds, they
      flew,<br /> And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view.<br /> Shot from
      the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd;<br /> Nor storms, nor thunder, equal
      half his haste.<br /> The next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd,<br />
      Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;<br /> Then Helymus, whom young Diores
      plied,<br /> Step after step, and almost side by side,<br /> His shoulders
      pressing; and, in longer space,<br /> Had won, or left at least a dubious
      race.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,<br /> When eager Nisus,
      hapless in his haste,<br /> Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the
      plain,<br /> Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain.<br /> The careless
      victor had not mark'd his way;<br /> But, treading where the treach'rous
      puddle lay,<br /> His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor<br /> He fell,
      besmear'd with filth and holy gore.<br /> Not mindless then, Euryalus, of
      thee,<br /> Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,<br /> He strove th' immediate
      rival's hope to cross,<br /> And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.<br />
      So Salius lay extended on the plain;<br /> Euryalus springs out, the prize
      to gain,<br /> And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend<br /> The
      victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend.<br /> Next Helymus; and
      then Diores came,<br /> By two misfortunes made the third in fame.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud<br /> For justice, deafens and
      disturbs the crowd;<br /> Urges his cause may in the court be heard;<br />
      And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd.<br /> But favor for Euryalus
      appears;<br /> His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,<br /> Had brib'd
      the judges for the promis'd prize.<br /> Besides, Diores fills the court
      with cries,<br /> Who vainly reaches at the last reward,<br /> If the first
      palm on Salius be conferr'd.<br /> Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes
      arise:<br /> Where fortune plac'd it, I award the prize.<br /> But fortune's
      errors give me leave to mend,<br /> At least to pity my deserving friend."<br />
      He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws<br /> (Pond'rous with shaggy
      mane and golden paws)<br /> A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives.<br />
      Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.<br /> "If such rewards to
      vanquish'd men are due."<br /> He said, "and falling is to rise by you,<br />
      What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,<br /> Who merited the first
      rewards and fame?<br /> In falling, both an equal fortune tried;<br /> Would
      fortune for my fall so well provide!"<br /> With this he pointed to his
      face, and show'd<br /> His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood.<br />
      Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd,<br /> And caus'd to be produc'd
      an ample shield,<br /> Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,<br /> Long
      since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought.<br /> This giv'n to Nisus, he
      divides the rest,<br /> And equal justice in his gifts express'd.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd,<br /> Once more the prince
      bespeaks th' attentive crowd:<br /> "If there he here whose dauntless
      courage dare<br /> In gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare,<br /> His
      opposite sustain in open view,<br /> Stand forth the champion, and the
      games renew.<br /> Two prizes I propose, and thus divide:<br /> A bull with
      gilded horns, and fillets tied,<br /> Shall be the portion of the
      conqu'ring chief;<br /> A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;<br /> Stalking he strides, his
      head erected bears:<br /> His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,<br />
      And loud applauses echo thro' the field.<br /> Dares alone in combat us'd
      to stand<br /> The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;<br /> The same, at
      Hector's fun'rals, undertook<br /> Gigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock,<br />
      And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,<br /> Stretch'd the vast bulk
      upon the yellow sand.<br /> Such Dares was; and such he strode along,<br />
      And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.<br /> His brawny back and ample
      breast he shows,<br /> His lifted arms around his head he throws,<br /> And
      deals in whistling air his empty blows.<br /> His match is sought; but,
      thro' the trembling band,<br /> Not one dares answer to the proud demand.<br />
      Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes<br /> Already he devours the
      promis'd prize.<br /> He claims the bull with awless insolence,<br /> And
      having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince:<br /> "If none my matchless
      valor dares oppose,<br /> How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?<br />
      Permit me, chief, permit without delay,<br /> To lead this uncontended gift
      away."<br /> The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries<br /> For the proud
      challenger demands the prize.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see<br /> The palm usurp'd without a
      victory,<br /> Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside,<br /> And heard
      and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride:<br /> "Once, but in vain, a champion
      of renown,<br /> So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown,<br /> A prize in
      triumph borne before your sight,<br /> And shun, for fear, the danger of
      the fight?<br /> Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,<br /> The god who
      taught your thund'ring arm the game?<br /> Where now your baffled honor?
      Where the spoil<br /> That fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our
      isle?"<br /> Entellus, thus: "My soul is still the same,<br /> Unmov'd with
      fear, and mov'd with martial fame;<br /> But my chill blood is curdled in
      my veins,<br /> And scarce the shadow of a man remains.<br /> O could I turn
      to that fair prime again,<br /> That prime of which this boaster is so
      vain,<br /> The brave, who this decrepid age defies,<br /> Should feel my
      force, without the promis'd prize."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      He said; and, rising at the word, he threw<br /> Two pond'rous gauntlets
      down in open view;<br /> Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,<br />
      And sheathe his hands with in the listed field.<br /> With fear and wonder
      seiz'd, the crowd beholds<br /> The gloves of death, with sev'n
      distinguish'd folds<br /> Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread<br />
      With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:<br /> Dares himself was daunted at
      the sight,<br /> Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight.<br />
      Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands,<br /> And pois'd the pond'rous
      engines in his hands.<br /> "What had your wonder," said Entellus, "been,<br />
      Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,<br /> Or view'd the stern debate on
      this unhappy green!<br /> These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,<br />
      Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore.<br /> With these he
      long sustain'd th' Herculean arm;<br /> And these I wielded while my blood
      was warm,<br /> This languish'd frame while better spirits fed,<br /> Ere
      age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head.<br /> But if the
      challenger these arms refuse,<br /> And cannot wield their weight, or dare
      not use;<br /> If great Aeneas and Acestes join<br /> In his request, these
      gauntlets I resign;<br /> Let us with equal arms perform the fight,<br />
      And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;<br /> Stripp'd of his quilted
      coat, his body bares;<br /> Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands,<br />
      A goodly tow'ring object on the sands.<br /> Then just Aeneas equal arms
      supplied,<br /> Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.<br />
      Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,<br /> Their arms aloft, their
      bodies inly bent;<br /> Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;<br />
      With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.<br /> One on his youth and
      pliant limbs relies;<br /> One on his sinews and his giant size.<br /> The
      last is stiff with age, his motion slow;<br /> He heaves for breath, he
      staggers to and fro,<br /> And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly
      blow.<br /> Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;<br /> Their ways
      are diff'rent, but their art alike.<br /> Before, behind, the blows are
      dealt; around<br /> Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.<br /> A
      storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,<br /> And errs about their
      temples, ears, and eyes.<br /> Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws<br />
      A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.<br /> Heavy with age, Entellus
      stands his ground,<br /> But with his warping body wards the wound.<br />
      His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;<br /> While Dares traverses and
      shifts his place,<br /> And, like a captain who beleaguers round<br /> Some
      strong-built castle on a rising ground,<br /> Views all th' approaches with
      observing eyes:<br /> This and that other part in vain he tries,<br /> And
      more on industry than force relies.<br /> With hands on high, Entellus
      threats the foe;<br /> But Dares watch'd the motion from below,<br /> And
      slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow.<br /> Entellus wastes
      his forces on the wind,<br /> And, thus deluded of the stroke design'd,<br />
      Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast<br /> And weighty limbs his
      ancient mother press'd.<br /> So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood<br />
      On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood,<br /> Torn from the roots. The
      diff'ring nations rise,<br /> And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the
      skies,<br /> Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise<br /> The fall'n
      companion of his youthful days.<br /> Dauntless he rose, and to the fight
      return'd;<br /> With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn'd.<br />
      Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast,<br /> And with redoubled
      force his foe he press'd.<br /> He lays on load with either hand, amain,<br />
      And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain;<br /> Nor stops, nor stays;
      nor rest nor breath allows;<br /> But storms of strokes descend about his
      brows,<br /> A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.<br /> But now the
      prince, who saw the wild increase<br /> Of wounds, commands the combatants
      to cease,<br /> And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace.<br /> First
      to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,<br /> And sooth'd his sorrow for
      the suffer'd shame.<br /> "What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods," said he,<br />
      "To him propitious, and averse to thee,<br /> Have giv'n his arm superior
      force to thine.<br /> 'T is madness to contend with strength divine."<br />
      The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore<br /> His faithful friends
      unhappy Dares bore:<br /> His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood,<br />
      And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.<br /> Faintly he stagger'd
      thro' the hissing throng,<br /> And hung his head, and trail'd his legs
      along.<br /> The sword and casque are carried by his train;<br /> But with
      his foe the palm and ox remain.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The champion, then, before Aeneas came,<br /> Proud of his prize, but
      prouder of his fame:<br /> "O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,<br />
      Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;<br /> Learn what I was, by what
      remains; and know<br /> From what impending fate you sav'd my foe."<br />
      Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;<br /> And, on his ample
      forehead aiming full,<br /> The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the
      skull.<br /> Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,<br /> But
      sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.<br /> Then, thus: "In
      Dares' stead I offer this.<br /> Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;<br /> Take
      the last gift my wither'd arms can yield:<br /> Thy gauntlets I resign, and
      here renounce the field."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,<br /> The strife of archers with
      contending bows.<br /> The mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore<br /> With
      his own hands he raises on the shore.<br /> A flutt'ring dove upon the top
      they tie,<br /> The living mark at which their arrows fly.<br /> The rival
      archers in a line advance,<br /> Their turn of shooting to receive from
      chance.<br /> A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:<br /> On the
      first scroll was read Hippocoon.<br /> The people shout. Upon the next was
      found<br /> Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd.<br /> The third
      contain'd Eurytion's noble name,<br /> Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in
      fame,<br /> Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound,<br /> And send among
      the Greeks a feather'd wound.<br /> Acestes in the bottom last remain'd,<br />
      Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd.<br /> Soon all with vigor
      bend their trusty bows,<br /> And from the quiver each his arrow chose.<br />
      Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway<br /> It flew, and, whizzing,
      cut the liquid way.<br /> Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands:<br />
      The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,<br /> And the tree trembled, and
      the shouting cries<br /> Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies.<br />
      Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,<br /> With lifted eyes, and
      took his aim above,<br /> But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;<br />
      Yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord<br /> Which fasten'd by the foot
      the flitting bird.<br /> The captive thus releas'd, away she flies,<br />
      And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.<br /> His bow already
      bent, Eurytion stood;<br /> And, having first invok'd his brother god,<br />
      His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.<br /> The fatal message reach'd
      her as she fled:<br /> She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,<br />
      And renders back the weapon in the wound.<br /> Acestes, grudging at his
      lot, remains,<br /> Without a prize to gratify his pains.<br /> Yet,
      shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show<br /> An archer's art, and boast
      his twanging bow.<br /> The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent,<br /> And
      latter augurs judge from this event.<br /> Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd;
      and, as it flew,<br /> A trail of following flames ascending drew:<br />
      Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;<br /> Across the skies as
      falling meteors play,<br /> And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.<br />
      The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,<br /> And, trembling, turn their
      wonder into pray'r.<br /> The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,<br /> And
      strain'd Acestes with a close embrace;<br /> Then, hon'ring him with gifts
      above the rest,<br /> Turn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd.<br />
      "The gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought,<br /> And order'd you the
      prize without the lot.<br /> Accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold,<br />
      Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:<br /> This pledge of ancient
      amity receive,<br /> Which to my second sire I justly give."<br /> He said,
      and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound,<br /> Proclaim'd him victor, and
      with laurel-crown'd.<br /> Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,<br />
      Tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies.<br /> Who cut the line, with
      second gifts was grac'd;<br /> The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the
      mast.<br />

      The chief, before the games were wholly done,<br /> Call'd Periphantes,

      grace his grandsire's day,<br /> And lead his equals arm'd in just array."<br />
      He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.<br /> The crowd withdrawn,
      an open plain appears.<br /> And now the noble youths, of form divine,<br />

      lovely features of his face,<br /> Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,<br />

      declare her doom.<br /> In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands<br /> (For
      this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:<br /> 'With these,' said she,
      'these wand'ring ships destroy:<br /> These are your fatal seats, and this
      your Troy.'<br /> Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:<br /> Slack
      not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires<br /> Our minds to dare, and

      seiz'd with new amaze,<br /> Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy
      gaze.<br /> They fear, and hope, and neither part obey:<br /> They hope the
      fated land, but fear the fatal way.<br /> The goddess, having done her task

      prosecute their mad design:<br /> They shriek aloud; they snatch, with
      impious hands,<br /> The food of altars; fires and flaming brands.<br />
      Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste,<br /> And smoking
      torches, on the ships they cast.<br /> The flame, unstopp'd at first, more
      fury gains,<br /> And Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins:<br />
      Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,<br /> And seizes, in this way,
      the banks and crackling oars.<br /> Eumelus was the first the news to bear,<br />

      witness'd by their eyes:<br /> A storm of sparkles and of flames arise.<br />
      Ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he led<br /> His early warriors on his
      prancing steed,<br /> And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd;<br />
      Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.<br /> Soon as the royal
      youth appear'd in view,<br /> He sent his voice before him as he flew:<br />

      unhappy Troy!<br /> Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,<br />
      And on your friends your fatal fury turn.<br /> Behold your own Ascanius!"

      green timber eats,<br /> And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.<br /> Down to
      the keels, and upward to the sails,<br /> The fire descends, or mounts, but

    <p class="poem">
      But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide;<br /> If he should still in
      Sicily reside,<br /> Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,<br /> In
      hope the promis'd Italy to gain.<br /> Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom
      alone<br /> The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown;<br /> Vers'd in
      portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd<br /> To tell events, and what the
      fates requir'd;<br /> Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd,<br />
      With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind:<br /> "O goddess-born,
      resign'd in ev'ry state,<br /> With patience bear, with prudence push your
      fate.<br /> By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue;<br /> Fly when she
      frowns, and, when she calls, pursue.<br /> Your friend Acestes is of Trojan
      kind;<br /> To him disclose the secrets of your mind:<br /> Trust in his
      hands your old and useless train;<br /> Too num'rous for the ships which
      yet remain:<br /> The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,<br /> The dames
      who dread the dangers of the seas,<br /> With all the dastard crew, who
      dare not stand<br /> The shock of battle with your foes by land.<br /> Here
      you may build a common town for all,<br /> And, from Acestes' name, Acesta
      call."<br /> The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd,<br />
      Encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      'T was dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes<br /> His father's shade
      descended from the skies,<br /> And thus he spoke: "O more than vital
      breath,<br /> Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death;<br /> O son,
      in various toils and troubles toss'd,<br /> The King of Heav'n employs my
      careful ghost<br /> On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire<br /> Your
      flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.<br /> The wholesome counsel of
      your friend receive,<br /> And here the coward train and woman leave:<br />
      The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,<br /> Transport, to tempt the
      dangers of the war.<br /> The stern Italians will their courage try;<br />
      Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.<br /> But first to
      Pluto's palace you shall go,<br /> And seek my shade among the blest below:<br />
      For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,<br /> Nor suffers with the
      damn'd perpetual pains,<br /> But breathes the living air of soft Elysian
      plains.<br /> The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,<br /> And blood of
      offer'd victims free the way.<br /> There shall you know what realms the
      gods assign,<br /> And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.<br /> But
      now, farewell! I vanish with the night,<br /> And feel the blast of
      heav'n's approaching light."<br /> He said, and mix'd with shades, and took
      his airy flight.<br /> "Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried;<br /> "And
      why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires,<br /> He rakes hot embers, and
      renews the fires;<br /> His country gods and Vesta then adores<br /> With
      cakes and incense, and their aid implores.<br /> Next, for his friends and
      royal host he sent,<br /> Reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent,<br />
      With his own purpose. All, without delay,<br /> The will of Jove, and his
      desires obey.<br /> They list with women each degenerate name,<br /> Who
      dares not hazard life for future fame.<br /> These they cashier: the brave
      remaining few,<br /> Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew.<br />
      The prince designs a city with the plow;<br /> The lots their sev'ral
      tenements allow.<br /> This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy,<br />
      And the new king ascends the throne with joy;<br /> A chosen senate from
      the people draws;<br /> Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws.<br />
      Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin<br /> A rising temple to the Paphian
      queen.<br /> Anchises, last, is honor'd as a god;<br /> A priest is added,
      annual gifts bestow'd,<br /> And groves are planted round his blest abode.<br />
      Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd;<br /> And fumes of
      incense in the fanes abound.<br /> Then from the south arose a gentle
      breeze<br /> That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;<br /> The rising
      winds a ruffling gale afford,<br /> And call the merry mariners aboard.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now loud laments along the shores resound,<br /> Of parting friends in
      close embraces bound.<br /> The trembling women, the degenerate train,<br />
      Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main,<br /> Ev'n those desire to
      sail, and take their share<br /> Of the rough passage and the promis'd war:<br />
      Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends<br /> To their new master's care
      his fearful friends.<br /> On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;<br />
      A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;<br /> Then slips his haulsers, and
      his anchors weighs.<br /> High on the deck the godlike hero stands,<br />
      With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;<br /> Then cast the reeking
      entrails in the brine,<br /> And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.<br />
      Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,<br /> And brush the buxom
      seas, and o'er the billows fly.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,<br /> To Neptune thus
      address'd, with tender tears:<br /> "The pride of Jove's imperious queen,
      the rage,<br /> The malice which no suff'rings can assuage,<br /> Compel me
      to these pray'rs; since neither fate,<br /> Nor time, nor pity, can remove
      her hate:<br /> Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;<br /> Still
      vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.<br /> As if 't were little to
      consume the town<br /> Which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,<br />
      She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,<br /> And gnaws, ev'n to the
      bones, the last remains.<br /> Let her the causes of her hatred tell;<br />
      But you can witness its effects too well.<br /> You saw the storm she
      rais'd on Libyan floods,<br /> That mix'd the mounting billows with the
      clouds;<br /> When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,<br /> And mov'd
      rebellion in your wat'ry reign.<br /> With fury she possess'd the Dardan
      dames,<br /> To burn their fleet with execrable flames,<br /> And forc'd
      Aeneas, when his ships were lost,<br /> To leave his foll'wers on a foreign
      coast.<br /> For what remains, your godhead I implore,<br /> And trust my
      son to your protecting pow'r.<br /> If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree
      withstand,<br /> Secure his passage to the Latian land."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:<br /> "What may not Venus hope from
      Neptune's reign?<br /> My kingdom claims your birth; my late defense<br />
      Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence.<br /> Nor less by land
      than sea my deeds declare<br /> How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care.<br />
      Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest.<br /> Your Trojan troops when
      proud Achilles press'd,<br /> And drove before him headlong on the plain,<br />
      And dash'd against the walls the trembling train;<br /> When floods were
      fill'd with bodies of the slain;<br /> When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of
      his way,<br /> Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;<br /> (New heaps came
      tumbling in, and chok'd his way;)<br /> When your Aeneas fought, but fought
      with odds<br /> Of force unequal, and unequal gods;<br /> I spread a cloud
      before the victor's sight,<br /> Sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his
      flight;<br /> Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy<br /> The vow'd
      destruction of ungrateful Troy.<br /> My will's the same: fair goddess,
      fear no more,<br /> Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;<br />
      Their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone<br /> Shall perish, and for
      multitudes atone."<br /> Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind,<br />
      His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd,<br /> Then adds the foamy bridle
      to their jaws,<br /> And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws.<br /> High
      on the waves his azure car he guides;<br /> Its axles thunder, and the sea
      subsides,<br /> And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.<br /> The
      tempests fly before their father's face,<br /> Trains of inferior gods his
      triumph grace,<br /> And monster whales before their master play,<br /> And
      choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way.<br /> The marshal'd pow'rs in equal
      troops divide<br /> To right and left; the gods his better side<br />
      Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,<br /> Within the hero's mind his
      joys renew'd.<br /> He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;<br />
      The cheerful crew with diligence obey;<br /> They scud before the wind, and
      sail in open sea.<br /> Ahead of all the master pilot steers;<br /> And, as
      he leads, the following navy veers.<br /> The steeds of Night had travel'd
      half the sky,<br /> The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,<br /> When the
      soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,<br /> Descends, and draws behind a
      trail of light.<br /> Thou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey;<br /> To thee
      alone he takes his fatal way.<br /> Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he
      bears;<br /> And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.<br />
      Then thus the traitor god began his tale:<br /> "The winds, my friend,
      inspire a pleasing gale;<br /> The ships, without thy care, securely sail.<br />
      Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I<br /> Will take the rudder and thy
      room supply."<br /> To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:<br /> "Me dost
      thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep,<br /> The harlot smiles of her
      dissembling face,<br /> And to her faith commit the Trojan race?<br /> Shall
      I believe the Siren South again,<br /> And, oft betray'd, not know the
      monster main?"<br /> He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep,<br /> And,
      fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep.<br /> The god was wroth,
      and at his temples threw<br /> A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with
      Stygian dew:<br /> The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine,<br /> Soon
      clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine.<br /> Scarce were his limbs
      extended at their length,<br /> The god, insulting with superior strength,<br />
      Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea,<br /> And, with the stern, the
      rudder tore away.<br /> Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,<br />
      Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.<br /> The victor daemon
      mounts obscure in air,<br /> While the ship sails without the pilot's care.<br />
      On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;<br /> But what the man
      forsook, the god supplies,<br /> And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the
      navy flies;<br /> Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,<br /> Long
      infamous for ships and sailors lost,<br /> And white with bones. Th'
      impetuous ocean roars,<br /> And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.<br />
      The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found<br /> The tossing vessel
      sail'd on shoaly ground.<br /> Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself<br />
      The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.<br /> Inly he griev'd,
      and, groaning from the breast,<br /> Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain
      express'd:<br /> "For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky,<br />
      Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie."<br />

      He said, and wept; then spread his sails before<br /> The winds, and
      reach'd at length the Cumaean shore:<br /> Their anchors dropp'd, his crew
      the vessels moor.<br /> They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,<br />
      And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand.<br /> Some strike from
      clashing flints their fiery seed;<br /> Some gather sticks, the kindled
      flames to feed,<br /> Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods,<br />
      Or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods.<br /> Thus, while their
      sev'ral charges they fulfil,<br /> The pious prince ascends the sacred hill<br />
      Where Phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade<br /> Which hides from sight
      his venerable maid.<br /> Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;<br /> Thence
      full of fate returns, and of the god.<br /> Thro' Trivia's grove they walk;
      and now behold,<br /> And enter now, the temple roof'd with gold.<br /> When
      Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,<br /> His heavy limbs on jointed pinions
      bore,<br /> (The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame,<br /> To the
      Cumaean coast at length he came,<br /> And here alighting, built this
      costly frame.<br /> Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high<br /> The
      steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:<br /> Then o'er the lofty gate his
      art emboss'd<br /> Androgeos' death, and off'rings to his ghost;<br /> Sev'n
      youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet<br /> The fate appointed by
      revengeful Crete.<br /> And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd,<br />
      In which the destin'd names by lots were cast:<br /> The mournful parents
      stand around in tears,<br /> And rising Crete against their shore appears.<br />
      There too, in living sculpture, might be seen<br /> The mad affection of
      the Cretan queen;<br /> Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye;<br />
      The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny,<br /> The lower part a beast, a man
      above,<br /> The monument of their polluted love.<br /> Not far from thence
      he grav'd the wondrous maze,<br /> A thousand doors, a thousand winding
      ways:<br /> Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,<br /> Not to be
      found, but by the faithful clew;<br /> Till the kind artist, mov'd with
      pious grief,<br /> Lent to the loving maid this last relief,<br /> And all
      those erring paths describ'd so well<br /> That Theseus conquer'd and the
      monster fell.<br /> Here hapless Icarus had found his part,<br /> Had not
      the father's grief restrain'd his art.<br /> He twice assay'd to cast his
      son in gold;<br /> Twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      All this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd;<br /> Each varying object his
      delight renew'd:<br /> Eager to read the rest- Achates came,<br /> And by
      his side the mad divining dame,<br /> The priestess of the god, Deiphobe
      her name.<br /> "Time suffers not," she said, "to feed your eyes<br /> With
      empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice.<br /> Sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd,
      for Phoebus choose,<br /> And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes."<br /> This
      said, the servants urge the sacred rites,<br /> While to the temple she the
      prince invites.<br /> A spacious cave, within its farmost part,<br /> Was
      hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art<br /> Thro' the hill's hollow sides:
      before the place,<br /> A hundred doors a hundred entries grace;<br /> As
      many voices issue, and the sound<br /> Of Sybil's words as many times
      rebound.<br /> Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries:<br /> "This is
      the time; enquire your destinies.<br /> He comes; behold the god!" Thus
      while she said,<br /> (And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,)<br /> Her
      color chang'd; her face was not the same,<br /> And hollow groans from her
      deep spirit came.<br /> Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd<br />
      Her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast.<br /> Greater than
      humankind she seem'd to look,<br /> And with an accent more than mortal
      spoke.<br /> Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;<br /> When all the
      god came rushing on her soul.<br /> Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she
      spoke:<br /> "Why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke!<br /> Thy
      pray'rs alone can open this abode;<br /> Else vain are my demands, and dumb
      the god."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,<br /> O'erspread with a damp
      sweat and holy fear.<br /> The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd,<br />
      His vows to great Apollo thus address'd:<br /> "Indulgent god, propitious
      pow'r to Troy,<br /> Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,<br /> Directed
      by whose hand the Dardan dart<br /> Pierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal

      ambient seas and thro' devouring sands,<br /> Our exil'd crew has sought
      th' Ausonian ground;<br /> And now, at length, the flying coast is found.<br />
      Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,<br /> With fury has pursued
      her wand'ring race.<br /> Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance
      end:<br /> Troy is no more, and can no more offend.<br /> And thou, O sacred
      maid, inspir'd to see<br /> Th' event of things in dark futurity;<br /> Give
      me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate,<br /> To conquer and command the
      Latian state;<br /> To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place<br /> For the
      long exiles of the Trojan race.<br /> Then shall my grateful hands a temple
      rear<br /> To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;<br /> And annual
      rites, and festivals, and games,<br /> Shall be perform'd to their
      auspicious names.<br /> Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land;<br /> For
      there thy faithful oracles shall stand,<br /> Preserv'd in shrines; and
      ev'ry sacred lay,<br /> Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:<br /> All
      shall be treasur'd by a chosen train<br /> Of holy priests, and ever shall
      remain.<br /> But O! commit not thy prophetic mind<br /> To flitting leaves,
      the sport of ev'ry wind,<br /> Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;<br />
      Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate."<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,<br /> And lab'ring underneath
      the pond'rous god,<br /> The more she strove to shake him from her breast,<br />
      With more and far superior force he press'd;<br /> Commands his entrance,
      and, without control,<br /> Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.<br />
      Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors<br /> Ope of themselves; a
      rushing whirlwind roars<br /> Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:<br />
      "Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign,<br /> Yet more and greater ills
      by land remain.<br /> The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event),<br />
      Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent.<br /> Wars, horrid
      wars, I view- a field of blood,<br /> And Tiber rolling with a purple
      flood.<br /> Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:<br /> A new Achilles
      shall in arms appear,<br /> And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate,<br />
      Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.<br /> To what strange nations
      shalt not thou resort,<br /> Driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court!<br /> The
      cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd;<br /> A foreign mistress, and a
      foreign guest.<br /> But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,<br /> The

    <p class="poem">
      Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,<br /> And the resisting air
      the thunder broke;<br /> The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook.<br />
      Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast,<br /> In these mysterious
      words his mind express'd;<br /> Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the
      rest.<br /> At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd,<br /> And, ebbing
      in her soul, the god decreas'd.<br /> Then thus the chief: "No terror to my
      view,<br /> No frightful face of danger can be new.<br /> Inur'd to suffer,
      and resolv'd to dare,<br /> The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without
      my care.<br /> This let me crave, since near your grove the road<br /> To
      hell lies open, and the dark abode<br /> Which Acheron surrounds, th'
      innavigable flood;<br /> Conduct me thro' the regions void of light,<br />
      And lead me longing to my father's sight.<br /> For him, a thousand dangers
      I have sought,<br /> And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,<br />
      Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.<br /> He, for my sake, the
      raging ocean tried,<br /> And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide,<br />
      And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.<br /> Oft, since he
      breath'd his last, in dead of night<br /> His reverend image stood before
      my sight;<br /> Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade;<br /> Conducted
      there by your unerring aid.<br /> But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are
      won,<br /> Oblige the father, and protect the son.<br /> Yours is the pow'r;
      nor Proserpine in vain<br /> Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.<br />
      If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre,<br /> The ruthless king with
      pity could inspire,<br /> And from the shades below redeem his wife;<br />
      If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life,<br /> Could free his brother, and
      can daily go<br /> By turns aloft, by turns descend below-<br /> Why name I
      Theseus, or his greater friend,<br /> Who trod the downward path, and
      upward could ascend?<br /> Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;<br />
      My mother greater, my descent the same."<br /> So pray'd the Trojan prince,
      and, while he pray'd,<br /> His hand upon the holy altar laid.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then thus replied the prophetess divine:<br /> "O goddess-born of great
      Anchises' line,<br /> The gates of hell are open night and day;<br /> Smooth
      the descent, and easy is the way:<br /> But to return, and view the
      cheerful skies,<br /> In this the task and mighty labor lies.<br /> To few
      great Jupiter imparts this grace,<br /> And those of shining worth and
      heav'nly race.<br /> Betwixt those regions and our upper light,<br /> Deep
      forests and impenetrable night<br /> Possess the middle space: th' infernal
      bounds<br /> Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.<br /> But if so dire
      a love your soul invades,<br /> As twice below to view the trembling
      shades;<br /> If you so hard a toil will undertake,<br /> As twice to pass
      th' innavigable lake;<br /> Receive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove<br />
      There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove<br /> Claims it her own;
      thick woods and gloomy night<br /> Conceal the happy plant from human
      sight.<br /> One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!)<br /> The ductile
      rind and leaves of radiant gold:<br /> This from the vulgar branches must
      be torn,<br /> And to fair Proserpine the present borne,<br /> Ere leave be
      giv'n to tempt the nether skies.<br /> The first thus rent a second will

      wood, with lifted eyes, to see<br /> The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:<br />
      Then rend it off, as holy rites command;<br /> The willing metal will obey
      thy hand,<br /> Following with ease, if favor'd by thy fate,<br /> Thou art
      foredoom'd to view the Stygian state:<br /> If not, no labor can the tree
      constrain;<br /> And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.<br />
      Besides, you know not, while you here attend,<br /> Th' unworthy fate of
      your unhappy friend:<br /> Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,<br />
      Depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host.<br /> Pay first his pious
      dues; and, for the dead,<br /> Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;<br />
      Then, living turfs upon his body lay:<br /> This done, securely take the
      destin'd way,<br /> To find the regions destitute of day."<br />

      She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went<br /> Sad from the cave, and full
      of discontent,<br /> Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.<br /> Achates,
      the companion of his breast,<br /> Goes grieving by his side, with equal
      cares oppress'd.<br /> Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd<br />
      What friend the priestess by those words design'd.<br /> But soon they
      found an object to deplore:<br /> Misenus lay extended on the shore;<br />
      Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd<br /> The warrior trumpet in the
      field to sound;<br /> With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,<br />
      And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms.<br /> He serv'd great
      Hector, and was ever near,<br /> Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.<br />
      But by Pelides' arms when Hector fell,<br /> He chose Aeneas; and he chose
      as well.<br /> Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,<br /> He now
      provokes the sea gods from the shore;<br /> With envy Triton heard the
      martial sound,<br /> And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd;<br />
      Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:<br /> The gazing crowd around
      the body stand.<br /> All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,<br /> And
      hastens to perform the funeral state.<br /> In altar-wise, a stately pile
      they rear;<br /> The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air.<br /> An
      ancient wood, fit for the work design'd,<br /> (The shady covert of the
      salvage kind,)<br /> The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;<br />
      Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride<br /> Of forest ashes,
      feel the fatal stroke,<br /> And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.<br />
      Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown<br /> Of the bare
      mountains, roll with ruin down.<br /> Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince
      appears,<br /> And by his pious labor urges theirs.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind<br /> The ways to compass what
      his wish design'd,<br /> He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,<br /> And
      then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love:<br /> "O may thy pow'r,
      propitious still to me,<br /> Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,<br />
      In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath<br /> Foretold, alas! too
      true, Misenus' death."<br /> Scarce had he said, when, full before his
      sight,<br /> Two doves, descending from their airy flight,<br /> Secure upon
      the grassy plain alight.<br /> He knew his mother's birds; and thus he
      pray'd:<br /> "Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,<br /> And lead my
      footsteps, till the branch be found,<br /> Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds
      the sacred ground.<br /> And thou, great parent, with celestial care,<br />
      In this distress be present to my pray'r!"<br /> Thus having said, he
      stopp'd with watchful sight,<br /> Observing still the motions of their
      flight,<br /> What course they took, what happy signs they shew.<br /> They
      fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew<br /> Still farther from the
      place, but still in view:<br /> Hopping and flying, thus they led him on<br />
      To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun<br /> They wing'd their
      flight aloft; then, stooping low,<br /> Perch'd on the double tree that
      bears the golden bough.<br /> Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows
      glow;<br /> As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,<br /> Where the
      proud mother views her precious brood,<br /> And happier branches, which
      she never sow'd.<br /> Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind,<br />
      And dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind.<br /> He seiz'd the shining
      bough with griping hold,<br /> And rent away, with ease, the ling'ring
      gold;<br /> Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize.<br /> Meantime the
      Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,<br /> To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.<br />
      First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,<br /> Of pitch trees, oaks,
      and pines, and unctuous fir:<br /> The fabric's front with cypress twigs
      they strew,<br /> And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.<br /> The
      topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn;<br /> Warm waters, then, in brazen
      caldrons borne,<br /> Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint,<br /> And
      fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint.<br /> With groans and cries
      Misenus they deplore:<br /> Then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er,<br />
      The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay,<br /> And fire the pile,
      their faces turn'd away-<br /> Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to
      pay.<br /> Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,<br /> And fat of
      victims, which his friends bestow.<br /> These gifts the greedy flames to
      dust devour;<br /> Then on the living coals red wine they pour;<br /> And,
      last, the relics by themselves dispose,<br /> Which in a brazen urn the
      priests inclose.<br /> Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew,<br /> And
      dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew;<br /> Which thrice he sprinkled round,
      and thrice aloud<br /> Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.<br />
      But good Aeneas order'd on the shore<br /> A stately tomb, whose top a
      trumpet bore,<br /> A soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar.<br /> Thus was
      his friend interr'd; and deathless fame<br /> Still to the lofty cape
      consigns his name.<br /> These rites perform'd, the prince, without delay,<br />
      Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way.<br /> Deep was the cave; and,
      downward as it went<br /> From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;<br />
      And here th' access a gloomy grove defends,<br /> And there th' unnavigable
      lake extends,<br /> O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light,<br /> No bird
      presumes to steer his airy flight;<br /> Such deadly stenches from the
      depths arise,<br /> And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.<br /> From
      hence the Grecian bards their legends make,<br /> And give the name Avernus
      to the lake.<br /> Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,<br /> For
      sacrifice the pious hero brought.<br /> The priestess pours the wine
      betwixt their horns;<br /> Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation
      burns,<br /> Invoking Hecate hither to repair:<br /> A pow'rful name in hell
      and upper air.<br /> The sacred priests with ready knives bereave<br /> The
      beasts of life, and in full bowls receive<br /> The streaming blood: a lamb
      to Hell and Night<br /> (The sable wool without a streak of white)<br />
      Aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree,<br /> A barren heifer, Proserpine, to
      thee,<br /> With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills;<br /> Sev'n brawny bulls
      with his own hand he kills;<br /> Then on the broiling entrails oil he
      pours;<br /> Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours.<br /> Late the
      nocturnal sacrifice begun,<br /> Nor ended till the next returning sun.<br />
      Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,<br /> And howling dogs in
      glimm'ring light advance,<br /> Ere Hecate came. "Far hence be souls
      profane!"<br /> The Sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain!<br /> Now,
      Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;<br /> Assume thy courage, and
      unsheathe thy sword."<br /> She said, and pass'd along the gloomy space;<br />
      The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.<br />

      His course from Afric to the Latian shore,<br /> Fell headlong down. The

      Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end?<br /> For Phoebus, ever

      envious gods have sent me to the deep:<br /> But, while the stars and
      course of heav'n I keep,<br /> My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal

      drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd.<br /> Now by the winds and raging

      Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,<br /> Your ship should run
      against the rocky coast.<br /> Three blust'ring nights, borne by the
      southern blast,<br /> I floated, and discover'd land at last:<br /> High on
      a mounting wave my head I bore,<br /> Forcing my strength, and gath'ring to

      my blood th' unhospitable coast;<br /> And now, by winds and waves, my
      lifeless limbs are toss'd:<br /> Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,<br />
      Which I have lost for this eternal night!<br /> Or, if by dearer ties you
      may be won,<br /> By your dead sire, and by your living son,<br /> Redeem
      from this reproach my wand'ring ghost;<br /> Or with your navy seek the
      Velin coast,<br /> And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;<br /> Or, if a
      nearer way your mother shows,<br /> Without whose aid you durst not
      undertake<br /> This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake,<br /> Lend to
      this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er<br /> To the sweet banks of yon
      forbidden shore."<br /> Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:<br />
      "What hopes delude thee, miserable man?<br /> Think'st thou, thus
      unintomb'd, to cross the floods,<br /> To view the Furies and infernal
      gods,<br /> And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?<br /> Attend the term

      his pointed spear,<br /> Nor strong Alcides- men of mighty fame,<br /> And
      from th' immortal gods their lineage came.<br /> In fetters one the barking
      porter tied,<br /> And took him trembling from his sov'reign's side:<br />
      Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride."<br /> To whom the Sibyl
      thus: "Compose thy mind;<br /> Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force
      design'd.<br /> Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain<br /> Of
      airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,<br /> And with her grisly lord his
      lovely queen remain.<br /> The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,<br />
      Much fam'd for arms, and more for filial love,<br /> Is sent to seek his
      sire in your Elysian grove.<br /> If neither piety, nor Heav'n's command,<br />
      Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,<br /> This fatal present shall
      prevail at least."<br /> Then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within
      her vest.<br /> No more was needful: for the gloomy god<br /> Stood mute

      queen-<br /> A venerable gift, so rarely seen.<br /> His fury thus appeas'd,
      he puts to land;<br /> The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:<br />
      He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;<br /> The leaky vessel
      groans beneath the weight.<br /> Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the
      tides;<br /> The pressing water pours within her sides.<br /> His passengers

      Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,<br /> Absolves the just, and

      Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:<br /> Caeneus, a woman once, and
      once a man,<br /> But ending in the sex she first began.<br /> Not far from

      in blood;<br /> Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,<br /> Obscure in
      shades, and with a doubtful view,<br /> (Doubtful as he who sees, thro'
      dusky night,<br /> Or thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light,)<br />
      With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade;<br /> And, as his love
      inspir'd him, thus he said:<br /> "Unhappy queen! then is the common breath<br />
      Of rumor true, in your reported death,<br /> And I, alas! the cause? By
      Heav'n, I vow,<br /> And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below,<br />
      Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,<br /> Commanded by the gods, and
      forc'd by fate-<br /> Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might<br />
      Have sent me to these regions void of light,<br /> Thro' the vast empire of
      eternal night.<br /> Nor dar'd I to presume, that, press'd with grief,<br />
      My flight should urge you to this dire relief.<br /> Stay, stay your steps,
      and listen to my vows:<br /> 'T is the last interview that fate allows!"<br />
      In vain he thus attempts her mind to move<br /> With tears, and pray'rs,
      and late-repenting love.<br /> Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round,<br />
      But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground,<br /> And what he says and
      swears, regards no more<br /> Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows
      roar;<br /> But whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight,<br /> Hid in the
      forest and the shades of night;<br /> Then sought Sichaeus thro' the shady

      and long to know<br /> What bus'ness brought him to the realms below.<br />
      But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train,<br /> When his refulgent arms
      flash'd thro' the shady plain,<br /> Fled from his well-known face, with
      wonted fear,<br /> As when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear<br />
      Drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear.<br /> They
      rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes;<br /> But the weak voice
      deceiv'd their gasping throats.<br />

      Here Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found,<br /> Whose face and limbs were one
      continued wound:<br /> Dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears,<br />
      Spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears.<br /> He scarcely knew him,
      striving to disown<br /> His blotted form, and blushing to be known;<br />
      And therefore first began: "O Teucer's race,<br /> Who durst thy faultless
      figure thus deface?<br /> What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this
      dire disgrace?<br /> 'Twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night<br />
      Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight,<br /> Till tir'd, not forc'd,
      a glorious fate you chose,<br /> And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes.<br />
      But, in remembrance of so brave a deed,<br /> A tomb and fun'ral honors I
      decreed;<br /> Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains:<br /> The
      place your armor and your name retains.<br /> Your body too I sought, and,
      had I found,<br /> Design'd for burial in your native ground."<br />

      The ghost replied: "Your piety has paid<br /> All needful rites, to rest my
      wand'ring shade;<br /> But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,<br /> To
      Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life.<br /> These are the monuments of
      Helen's love:<br /> The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above.<br />
      You know in what deluding joys we pass'd<br /> The night that was by Heav'n
      decreed our last:<br /> For, when the fatal horse, descending down,<br />
      Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town<br /> She feign'd
      nocturnal orgies; left my bed,<br /> And, mix'd with Trojan dames, the
      dances led<br /> Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,<br /> Which
      rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade.<br /> With watching overworn,
      with cares oppress'd,<br /> Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,<br /> And
      heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd.<br /> Meantime my worthy wife our
      arms mislaid,<br /> And from beneath my head my sword convey'd;<br /> The
      door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls,<br /> Invites her former lord
      within my walls.<br /> Thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd,<br />
      And with new treasons would redeem the past.<br /> What need I more? Into
      the room they ran,<br /> And meanly murther'd a defenseless man.<br />
      Ulysses, basely born, first led the way.<br /> Avenging pow'rs! with
      justice if I pray,<br /> That fortune be their own another day!<br /> But
      answer you; and in your turn relate,<br /> What brought you, living, to the
      Stygian state:<br /> Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea,<br /> Or did
      you Heav'n's superior doom obey?<br /> Or tell what other chance conducts
      your way,<br /> To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats,<br /> Tumults
      and torments of th' infernal seats."<br />

      While thus in talk the flying hours they pass,<br /> The sun had finish'd
      more than half his race:<br /> And they, perhaps, in words and tears had
      spent<br /> The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent;<br /> But thus
      the Sibyl chides their long delay:<br /> "Night rushes down, and headlong
      drives the day:<br /> 'T is here, in different paths, the way divides;<br />
      The right to Pluto's golden palace guides;<br /> The left to that unhappy
      region tends,<br /> Which to the depth of Tartarus descends;<br /> The seat
      of night profound, and punish'd fiends."<br /> Then thus Deiphobus: "O
      sacred maid,<br /> Forbear to chide, and be your will obey'd!<br /> Lo! to
      the secret shadows I retire,<br /> To pay my penance till my years expire.<br />
      Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd,<br /> And born to better

      The hero, looking on the left, espied<br /> A lofty tow'r, and strong on

      She said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd,<br /> And chose the

      Pluto's love.<br /> These holy rites perform'd, they took their way<br />
      Where long extended plains of pleasure lay:<br /> The verdant fields with
      those of heav'n may vie,<br /> With ether vested, and a purple sky;<br />
      The blissful seats of happy souls below.<br /> Stars of their own, and
      their own suns, they know;<br /> Their airy limbs in sports they exercise,<br />
      And on the green contend the wrestler's prize.<br /> Some in heroic verse

      woods above, and hides his head below.<br /> Here patriots live, who, for
      their country's good,<br /> In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:<br />
      Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode,<br /> And poets worthy their

      To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd,<br /> And first to him
      surrounded by the rest<br /> (Tow'ring his height, and ample was his
      breast):<br /> "Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,<br /> Where lives
      Anchises, and where lies our way<br /> To find the hero, for whose only
      sake<br /> We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?"<br /> To
      this the sacred poet thus replied:<br /> "In no fix'd place the happy souls
      reside.<br /> In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,<br /> By crystal
      streams, that murmur thro' the meads:<br /> But pass yon easy hill, and
      thence descend;<br /> The path conducts you to your journey's end."<br />
      This said, he led them up the mountain's brow,<br /> And shews them all the
      shining fields below.<br /> They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful
      meadows go.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale,<br /> Review'd his muster'd race, and
      took the tale:<br /> Those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate,<br /> For
      future beings and new bodies wait-<br /> With studious thought observ'd th'
      illustrious throng,<br /> In nature's order as they pass'd along:<br />
      Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,<br /> In peaceful
      senates and successful war.<br /> He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,<br />
      Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.<br /> "Welcome," he said, "the
      gods' undoubted race!<br /> O long expected to my dear embrace!<br /> Once
      more 't is giv'n me to behold your face!<br /> The love and pious duty
      which you pay<br /> Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way.<br /> 'T is
      true, computing times, I now believ'd<br /> The happy day approach'd; nor
      are my hopes deceiv'd.<br /> What length of lands, what oceans have you
      pass'd;<br /> What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast?<br /> How
      have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most,<br /> When love assail'd you,
      on the Libyan coast."<br /> To this, the filial duty thus replies:<br />
      "Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes<br /> Appear'd, and often urg'd
      this painful enterprise.<br /> After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,<br />
      My navy rides at anchor in the bay.<br /> But reach your hand, O parent
      shade, nor shun<br /> The dear embraces of your longing son!"<br /> He said;
      and falling tears his face bedew:<br /> Then thrice around his neck his
      arms he threw;<br /> And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away,<br /> Like
      winds, or empty dreams that fly the day.<br />

      Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees<br /> A sep'rate grove, thro' which
      a gentle breeze<br /> Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the
      trees;<br /> And, just before the confines of the wood,<br /> The gliding
      Lethe leads her silent flood.<br /> About the boughs an airy nation flew,<br />
      Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew;<br /> In summer's heat
      on tops of lilies feed,<br /> And creep within their bells, to suck the
      balmy seed:<br /> The winged army roams the fields around;<br /> The rivers
      and the rocks remurmur to the sound.<br /> Aeneas wond'ring stood, then
      ask'd the cause<br /> Which to the stream the crowding people draws.<br />
      Then thus the sire: "The souls that throng the flood<br /> Are those to
      whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd:<br /> In Lethe's lake they long
      oblivion taste,<br /> Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.<br />
      Long has my soul desir'd this time and place,<br /> To set before your
      sight your glorious race,<br /> That this presaging joy may fire your mind<br />
      To seek the shores by destiny design'd."-<br /> "O father, can it be, that
      souls sublime<br /> Return to visit our terrestrial clime,<br /> And that
      the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death,<br /> Can covet lazy limbs and mortal
      breath?"<br />

      Anchises then, in order, thus begun<br /> To clear those wonders to his
      godlike son:<br /> "Know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame,<br />
      And flowing waters, and the starry flame,<br /> And both the radiant
      lights, one common soul<br /> Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.<br />
      This active mind, infus'd thro' all the space,<br /> Unites and mingles
      with the mighty mass.<br /> Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,<br />
      And birds of air, and monsters of the main.<br /> Th' ethereal vigor is in
      all the same,<br /> And every soul is fill'd with equal flame;<br /> As much
      as earthy limbs, and gross allay<br /> Of mortal members, subject to decay,<br />
      Blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day.<br /> From this coarse
      mixture of terrestrial parts,<br /> Desire and fear by turns possess their
      hearts,<br /> And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind,<br /> In the
      dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd,<br /> Assert the native skies, or own
      its heav'nly kind:<br /> Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;<br />
      But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains.<br /> The relics of
      inveterate vice they wear,<br /> And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face
      appear.<br /> For this are various penances enjoin'd;<br /> And some are
      hung to bleach upon the wind,<br /> Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd
      in fires,<br /> Till all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust expires.<br />
      All have their manes, and those manes bear:<br /> The few, so cleans'd, to
      these abodes repair,<br /> And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian
      air.<br /> Then are they happy, when by length of time<br /> The scurf is
      worn away of each committed crime;<br /> No speck is left of their habitual
      stains,<br /> But the pure ether of the soul remains.<br /> But, when a
      thousand rolling years are past,<br /> (So long their punishments and
      penance last,)<br /> Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god,<br />
      Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood,<br /> In large forgetful
      draughts to steep the cares<br /> Of their past labors, and their irksome
      years,<br /> That, unrememb'ring of its former pain,<br /> The soul may
      suffer mortal flesh again."<br />

      increase,<br /> And scour his armor from the rust of peace.<br /> Whom Ancus

      He paus'd; and, while with wond'ring eyes they view'd<br /> The passing
      spirits, thus his speech renew'd:<br /> "See great Marcellus! how, untir'd

      He, when his country, threaten'd with alarms,<br /> Requires his courage

      Feretrian Jove."<br /> Aeneas here beheld, of form divine,<br /> A godlike
      youth in glitt'ring armor shine,<br /> With great Marcellus keeping equal
      pace;<br /> But gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face.<br /> He saw,
      and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide,<br /> What and of whence was he, who
      press'd the hero's side:<br /> "His son, or one of his illustrious name?<br />
      How like the former, and almost the same!<br /> Observe the crowds that
      compass him around;<br /> All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting
      sound:<br /> But hov'ring mists around his brows are spread,<br /> And
      night, with sable shades, involves his head."<br /> "Seek not to know," the
      ghost replied with tears,<br /> "The sorrows of thy sons in future years.<br />
      This youth (the blissful vision of a day)<br /> Shall just be shown on
      earth, and snatch'd away.<br /> The gods too high had rais'd the Roman
      state,<br /> Were but their gifts as permanent as great.<br /> What groans
      of men shall fill the Martian field!<br /> How fierce a blaze his flaming
      pile shall yield!<br /> What fun'ral pomp shall floating Tiber see,<br />
      When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity!<br /> No youth shall
      equal hopes of glory give,<br /> No youth afford so great a cause to
      grieve;<br /> The Trojan honor, and the Roman boast,<br /> Admir'd when
      living, and ador'd when lost!<br /> Mirror of ancient faith in early youth!<br />
      Undaunted worth, inviolable truth!<br /> No foe, unpunish'd, in the
      fighting field<br /> Shall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield;<br />
      Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force,<br /> When thy sharp spurs
      shall urge thy foaming horse.<br /> Ah! couldst thou break thro' fate's
      severe decree,<br /> A new Marcellus shall arise in thee!<br /> Full
      canisters of fragrant lilies bring,<br /> Mix'd with the purple roses of

      He tells the future wars, ordain'd by fate;<br /> The strength and customs

      Now, when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid,<br /> He plow'd the
      Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd.<br /> From land a gentle breeze arose
      by night,<br /> Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright,<br /> And the
      sea trembled with her silver light.<br /> Now near the shelves of Circe's
      shores they run,<br /> (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,)<br /> A
      dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days<br /> In joyous songs; the
      rocks resound her lays:<br /> In spinning, or the loom, she spends the
      night,<br /> And cedar brands supply her father's light.<br /> From hence
      were heard, rebellowing to the main,<br /> The roars of lions that refuse
      the chain,<br /> The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears,<br />
      And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.<br /> These from
      their caverns, at the close of night,<br /> Fill the sad isle with horror
      and affright.<br /> Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r,<br />
      (That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,)<br /> With words and wicked
      herbs from humankind<br /> Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd.<br />
      Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host<br /> Should bear, or touch
      upon th' inchanted coast,<br /> Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by

      wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies;<br /> When Thetis blush'd in
      purple not her own,<br /> And from her face the breathing winds were blown,<br />
      A sudden silence sate upon the sea,<br /> And sweeping oars, with
      struggling, urge their way.<br /> The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,<br />
      Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:<br /> Betwixt the trees
      the Tiber took his course,<br /> With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward
      force,<br /> That drove the sand along, he took his way,<br /> And roll'd
      his yellow billows to the sea.<br /> About him, and above, and round the
      wood,<br /> The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,<br /> That bath'd
      within, or basked upon his side,<br /> To tuneful songs their narrow
      throats applied.<br /> The captain gives command; the joyful train<br />

      Latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd<br /> The Latin scepter, and his
      people blest:<br /> His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame<br /> His mother;
      fair Marica was her name.<br /> But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew<br />
      His birth from Saturn, if records be true.<br /> Thus King Latinus, in the
      third degree,<br /> Had Saturn author of his family.<br /> But this old
      peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed,<br /> Was blest with no male issue to
      succeed:<br /> His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;<br /> One
      only daughter heir'd the royal state.<br /> Fir'd with her love, and with
      ambition led,<br /> The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.<br />
      Among the crowd, but far above the rest,<br /> Young Turnus to the
      beauteous maid address'd.<br /> Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,<br />
      Was first, and favor'd by the Latian queen;<br /> With him she strove to
      join Lavinia's hand,<br /> But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood<br /> A laurel's trunk, a
      venerable wood;<br /> Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair<br />
      Was kept and cut with superstitious care.<br /> This plant Latinus, when
      his town he wall'd,<br /> Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd;<br />
      And last, in honor of his new abode,<br /> He vow'd the laurel to the
      laurel's god.<br /> It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)<br /> A swarm of
      bees, that cut the liquid sky,<br /> (Unknown from whence they took their
      airy flight,)<br /> Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;<br /> There
      with their clasping feet together clung,<br /> And a long cluster from the
      laurel hung.<br /> An ancient augur prophesied from hence:<br /> "Behold on
      Latian shores a foreign prince!<br /> From the same parts of heav'n his
      navy stands,<br /> To the same parts on earth; his army lands;<br /> The
      town he conquers, and the tow'r commands."<br />

      Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire<br /> Before the gods, and stood
      beside her sire,<br /> (Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke<br />
      Of incense, from the sacred altar broke,<br /> Caught her dishevel'd hair
      and rich attire;<br /> Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:<br /> From
      thence the fuming trail began to spread<br /> And lambent glories danc'd
      about her head.<br /> This new portent the seer with wonder views,<br />
      Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:<br /> "The nymph, who scatters
      flaming fires around,<br /> Shall shine with honor, shall herself be
      crown'd;<br /> But, caus'd by her irrevocable fate,<br /> War shall the
      country waste, and change the state."<br />

      Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,<br /> For counsel to his father
      Faunus went,<br /> And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy<br /> Which
      near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie.<br /> To these the Latian and the
      Sabine land<br /> Fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand.<br /> The
      priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease,<br /> And nightly visions in
      his slumber sees;<br /> A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,<br /> And,
      flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears:<br /> These he consults, the
      future fates to know,<br /> From pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.<br />
      Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies,<br /> Off'ring a hundred sheep
      for sacrifice:<br /> Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,<br /> He
      laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.<br /> No sooner were his eyes in
      slumber bound,<br /> When, from above, a more than mortal sound<br />
      Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:<br /> "Seek not, my seed, in
      Latian bands to yoke<br /> Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke.<br /> A
      foreign son upon thy shore descends,<br /> Whose martial fame from pole to
      pole extends.<br /> His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd,<br /> Not
      Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound:<br /> 'T is theirs whate'er the sun
      surveys around."<br /> These answers, in the silent night receiv'd,<br />

      Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread<br /> His table on the turf, with
      cakes of bread;<br /> And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed.<br />
      They sate; and, (not without the god's command,)<br /> Their homely fare
      dispatch'd, the hungry band<br /> Invade their trenchers next, and soon
      devour,<br /> To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.<br /> Ascanius
      this observ'd, and smiling said:<br /> "See, we devour the plates on which
      we fed."<br /> The speech had omen, that the Trojan race<br /> Should find
      repose, and this the time and place.<br /> Aeneas took the word, and thus
      replies,<br /> Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:<br /> "All hail, O
      earth! all hail, my household gods!<br /> Behold the destin'd place of your
      abodes!<br /> For thus Anchises prophesied of old,<br /> And this our fatal
      place of rest foretold:<br /> 'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,<br />
      By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat,<br /> Then ease your weary
      Trojans will attend,<br /> And the long labors of your voyage end.<br />
      Remember on that happy coast to build,<br /> And with a trench inclose the
      fruitful field.'<br /> This was that famine, this the fatal place<br />
      Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race.<br /> Then, on to-morrow's
      dawn, your care employ,<br /> To search the land, and where the cities lie,<br />
      And what the men; but give this day to joy.<br /> Now pour to Jove; and,
      after Jove is blest,<br /> Call great Anchises to the genial feast:<br />
      Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught;<br /> Enjoy the present
      hour; adjourn the future thought."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus having said, the hero bound his brows<br /> With leafy branches, then
      perform'd his vows;<br /> Adoring first the genius of the place,<br /> Then
      Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race,<br /> The nymphs, and native
      godheads yet unknown,<br /> And Night, and all the stars that gild her
      sable throne,<br /> And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove,<br /> And last his
      sire below, and mother queen above.<br /> Then heav'n's high monarch
      thunder'd thrice aloud,<br /> And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud.<br />
      Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew,<br /> The time was come their city
      to renew.<br /> Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd,<br /> The

      happy lands.<br /> The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways<br /> To

      his train selects,<br /> And to the Latian court their course directs,<br />
      (The spacious palace where their prince resides,)<br /> And all their heads
      with wreaths of olive hides.<br /> They go commission'd to require a peace,<br />
      And carry presents to procure access.<br /> Thus while they speed their

      reverence and delight.<br /> There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign
      pow'r;<br /> In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore<br /> Their
      awful axes and the rods before.<br /> Here the tribunal stood, the house of
      pray'r,<br /> And here the sacred senators repair;<br /> All at large

      Spent and disabled in so long a way?<br /> Say what you want: the Latians
      you shall find<br /> Not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd;<br />
      For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign,<br /> His hospitable customs we
      retain.<br /> I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)<br /> Th' Arunci

      He said. Ilioneus made this reply:<br /> "O king, of Faunus' royal family!<br />
      Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way,<br /> Nor did the stars our
      wand'ring course betray.<br /> Willing we sought your shores; and, hither
      bound,<br /> The port, so long desir'd, at length we found;<br /> From our
      sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd;<br /> Great as the greatest that
      the sun beheld.<br /> The god began our line, who rules above;<br /> And, as
      our race, our king descends from Jove:<br /> And hither are we come, by his
      command,<br /> To crave admission in your happy land.<br /> How dire a
      tempest, from Mycenae pour'd,<br /> Our plains, our temples, and our town
      devour'd;<br /> What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms<br /> Shook
      Asia's crown with European arms;<br /> Ev'n such have heard, if any such
      there be,<br /> Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;<br /> And such as,
      born beneath the burning sky<br /> And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.<br />
      From that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste,<br /> Such length of years,
      such various perils past,<br /> At last escap'd, to Latium we repair,<br />
      To beg what you without your want may spare:<br /> The common water, and
      the common air;<br /> Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,<br />
      Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods.<br /> Nor our admission shall
      your realm disgrace,<br /> Nor length of time our gratitude efface.<br />
      Besides, what endless honor you shall gain,<br /> To save and shelter
      Troy's unhappy train!<br /> Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear,<br />
      Renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war;<br /> Oft our alliance other
      lands desir'd,<br /> And, what we seek of you, of us requir'd.<br /> Despite
      not then, that in our hands we bear<br /> These holy boughs, sue with words
      of pray'r.<br /> Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,<br /> Have
      doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land.<br /> To these abodes our fleet
      Apollo sends;<br /> Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;<br /> Where
      Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force,<br /> And where Numicus opes his holy
      source.<br /> Besides, our prince presents, with his request,<br /> Some
      small remains of what his sire possess'd.<br /> This golden charger,
      snatch'd from burning Troy,<br /> Anchises did in sacrifice employ;<br />
      This royal robe and this tiara wore<br /> Old Priam, and this golden
      scepter bore<br /> In full assemblies, and in solemn games;<br /> These
      purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames."<br />

      Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around<br /> His eyes, and fix'd a
      while upon the ground.<br /> Intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;<br />
      Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,<br /> But pond'ring future things
      of wondrous weight;<br /> Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.<br />
      On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,<br /> And then revolv'd what
      Faunus had divin'd.<br /> This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed<br />
      To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed;<br /> This was the race that sure
      portents foreshew<br /> To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.<br /> At
      length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke:<br /> "The pow'rs," said he,
      "the pow'rs we both invoke,<br /> To you, and yours, and mine, propitious
      be,<br /> And firm our purpose with their augury!<br /> Have what you ask;
      your presents I receive;<br /> Land, where and when you please, with ample
      leave;<br /> Partake and use my kingdom as your own;<br /> All shall be
      yours, while I command the crown:<br /> And, if my wish'd alliance please
      your king,<br /> Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring.<br />
      Then let him not a friend's embraces fear;<br /> The peace is made when I
      behold him here.<br /> Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,<br /> I add
      to his commands my own request:<br /> One only daughter heirs my crown and
      state,<br /> Whom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate,<br /> Nor frequent
      prodigies, permit to join<br /> With any native of th' Ausonian line.<br />
      A foreign son-in-law shall come from far<br /> (Such is our doom), a chief
      renown'd in war,<br /> Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,<br />
      And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame.<br /> Himself to be the man
      the fates require,<br /> I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire."<br />

      He said, and then on each bestow'd a steed.<br /> Three hundred horses, in
      high stables fed,<br /> Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd:<br />
      Of these he chose the fairest and the best,<br /> To mount the Trojan
      troop. At his command<br /> The steeds caparison'd with purple stand,<br />
      With golden trappings, glorious to behold,<br /> And champ betwixt their
      teeth the foaming gold.<br /> Then to his absent guest the king decreed<br />
      A pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed,<br /> Who from their nostrils
      breath'd ethereal fire;<br /> Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,<br />
      By substituting mares produc'd on earth,<br /> Whose wombs conceiv'd a more
      than mortal birth.<br /> These draw the chariot which Latinus sends,<br />
      And the rich present to the prince commends.<br /> Sublime on stately
      steeds the Trojans borne,<br /> To their expecting lord with peace return.<br />

      But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height,<br /> As she from Argos took her
      airy flight,<br /> Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.<br /> She
      saw the Trojan and his joyful train<br /> Descend upon the shore, desert
      the main,<br /> Design a town, and, with unhop'd success,<br /> Th'
      embassadors return with promis'd peace.<br /> Then, pierc'd with pain, she
      shook her haughty head,<br /> Sigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she
      said:<br /> "O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!<br /> O fates of Troy,
      which Juno's fates oppose!<br /> Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,<br />
      But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?<br /> When execrable Troy in
      ashes lay,<br /> Thro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way.<br />
      Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend,<br /> Her rage disarm'd, her
      empire at an end.<br /> Breathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent?<br /> Or
      does my glutted spleen at length relent?<br /> As if 't were little from
      their town to chase,<br /> I thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race;<br />
      Ingag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main;<br /> But billows roar'd, and
      tempests rag'd in vain.<br /> What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,<br />
      When these they overpass, and those they shun?<br /> On Tiber's shores they
      land, secure of fate,<br /> Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate.<br />
      Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,<br /> And Jove himself gave
      way to Cynthia's wrath,<br /> Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;<br />
      (What great offense had either people done?)<br /> But I, the consort of
      the Thunderer,<br /> Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war,<br /> With
      various arts and arms in vain have toil'd,<br /> And by a mortal man at
      length am foil'd.<br /> If native pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt<br /> To
      seek for needful succor from without?<br /> If Jove and Heav'n my just
      desires deny,<br /> Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply.<br />
      Grant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree,<br /> The Trojan race to
      reign in Italy;<br /> At least I can defer the nuptial day,<br /> And with
      protracted wars the peace delay:<br /> With blood the dear alliance shall
      be bought,<br /> And both the people near destruction brought;<br /> So
      shall the son-in-law and father join,<br /> With ruin, war, and waste of
      either line.<br /> O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd<br /> With
      Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood!<br /> Bellona leads thee to thy
      lover's hand;<br /> Another queen brings forth another brand,<br /> To burn
      with foreign fires another land!<br /> A second Paris, diff'ring but in
      name,<br /> Shall fire his country with a second flame."<br />

      Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,<br /> With furious haste,
      and shoots the Stygian sound,<br /> To rouse Alecto from th' infernal seat<br />
      Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat.<br /> This Fury, fit for her
      intent, she chose;<br /> One who delights in wars and human woes.<br /> Ev'n
      Pluto hates his own misshapen race;<br /> Her sister Furies fly her hideous
      face;<br /> So frightful are the forms the monster takes,<br /> So fierce
      the hissings of her speckled snakes.<br /> Her Juno finds, and thus
      inflames her spite:<br /> "O virgin daughter of eternal Night,<br /> Give me
      this once thy labor, to sustain<br /> My right, and execute my just
      disdain.<br /> Let not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretense<br /> Of
      proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince.<br /> Expel from Italy that
      odious name,<br /> And let not Juno suffer in her fame.<br /> 'T is thine to
      ruin realms, o'erturn a state,<br /> Betwixt the dearest friends to raise
      debate,<br /> And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate.<br /> Thy hand o'er
      towns the fun'ral torch displays,<br /> And forms a thousand ills ten
      thousand ways.<br /> Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds<br /> Of
      envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:<br /> Confound the peace establish'd,

    <p class="poem">
      Smear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood,<br /> The Fury sprang above
      the Stygian flood;<br /> And on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night,<br />
      She to the Latian palace took her flight:<br /> There sought the queen's
      apartment, stood before<br /> The peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the
      door.<br /> Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast<br /> Fir'd with disdain
      for Turnus dispossess'd,<br /> And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.<br />
      From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes<br /> Her darling plague, the
      fav'rite of her snakes;<br /> With her full force she threw the poisonous
      dart,<br /> And fix'd it deep within Amata's heart,<br /> That, thus
      envenom'd, she might kindle rage,<br /> And sacrifice to strife her house
      husband's age.<br /> Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims<br /> Betwixt
      her linen and her naked limbs;<br /> His baleful breath inspiring, as he
      glides,<br /> Now like a chain around her neck he rides,<br /> Now like a
      fillet to her head repairs,<br /> And with his circling volumes folds her
      hairs.<br /> At first the silent venom slid with ease,<br /> And seiz'd her
      cooler senses by degrees;<br /> Then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too
      far,<br /> In plaintive accents she began the war,<br /> And thus bespoke
      her husband: "Shall," she said,<br /> "A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's
      bed?<br /> If nature plead not in a parent's heart,<br /> Pity my tears, and
      pity her desert.<br /> I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,<br />
      You in vain, reverse your cruel doom;<br /> The faithless pirate soon will
      set to sea,<br /> And bear the royal virgin far away!<br /> A guest like
      him, a Trojan guest before,<br /> In shew of friendship sought the Spartan
      shore,<br /> And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore.<br /> Think on a
      king's inviolable word;<br /> And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord:<br />
      To this false foreigner you give your throne,<br /> And wrong a friend, a
      kinsman, and a son.<br /> Resume your ancient care; and, if the god<br />
      Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,<br /> Know all are foreign,
      in a larger sense,<br /> Not born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence.<br />
      Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace,<br /> He springs from Inachus of
      Argive race."<br />

    <p class="poem">
      But when she saw her reasons idly spent,<br /> And could not move him from
      his fix'd intent,<br /> She flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd<br />
      Her vital parts, and poison'd all her breast;<br /> She raves, she runs
      with a distracted pace,<br /> And fills with horrid howls the public place.<br />
      And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,<br /> On the smooth
      pavement of an empty court;<br /> The wooden engine flies and whirls about,<br />
      Admir'd, with clamors, of the beardless rout;<br /> They lash aloud; each
      other they provoke,<br /> And lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke:<br />
      Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows<br /> Amidst the crowd, and
      kindles as she goes.<br /> Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,<br />
      And adds new ills to those contriv'd before:<br /> She flies the town, and,
      mixing with a throng<br /> Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,<br />
      Wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways,<br /> And with these
      arts the Trojan match delays.<br /> She feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried
      aloud,<br /> And to the buxom god the virgin vow'd.<br /> "Evoe! O Bacchus!"
      thus began the song;<br /> And "Evoe!" answer'd all the female throng.<br />
      "O virgin! worthy thee alone!" she cried;<br /> "O worthy thee alone!" the
      crew replied.<br /> "For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,<br />
      And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance."<br /> Like fury seiz'd the
      rest; the progress known,<br /> All seek the mountains, and forsake the
      town:<br /> All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear,<br /> Give to
      the wanton winds their flowing hair,<br /> And shrieks and shoutings rend
      the suff'ring air.<br /> The queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine,<br />
      Shook high above her head a flaming pine;<br /> Then roll'd her haggard
      eyes around the throng,<br /> And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song:<br />
      "Io, ye Latian dames! if any here<br /> Hold your unhappy queen, Amata,
      dear;<br /> If there be here," she said, "who dare maintain<br /> My right,
      nor think the name of mother vain;<br /> Unbind your fillets, loose your
      flowing hair,<br /> And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Amata's breast the Fury thus invades,<br /> And fires with rage, amid the
      sylvan shades;<br /> Then, when she found her venom spread so far,<br /> The
      royal house embroil'd in civil war,<br /> Rais'd on her dusky wings, she
      cleaves the skies,<br /> And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.<br />
      His town, as fame reports, was built of old<br /> By Danae, pregnant with
      almighty gold,<br /> Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train<br /> Of
      following Argives, thro' the stormy main,<br /> Driv'n by the southern
      blasts, was fated here to reign.<br /> 'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name
      it bears;<br /> Once a fair city, now consum'd with years.<br /> Here, in
      his lofty palace, Turnus lay,<br /> Betwixt the confines of the night and
      day,<br /> Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside<br /> Her looks and limbs,
      and with new methods tried<br /> The foulness of th' infernal form to hide.<br />
      Propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:<br /> Her face is furrow'd,
      and her front obscene;<br /> Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;<br />
      Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;<br /> Her hoary hair with
      holy fillets bound,<br /> Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd.<br />
      Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane<br /> Of Juno, now she seem'd, and
      thus began,<br /> Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:<br />
      "Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain<br /> In fighting fields, and
      conquer towns in vain?<br /> Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,<br />
      Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?<br /> The bride and scepter which thy
      blood has bought,<br /> The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.<br />
      Go now, deluded man, and seek again<br /> New toils, new dangers, on the
      dusty plain.<br /> Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;<br /> Protect
      the Latians in luxurious ease.<br /> This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I
      bear<br /> Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear.<br /> Haste; arm
      your Ardeans; issue to the plain;<br /> With fate to friend, assault the
      Trojan train:<br /> Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie<br />
      In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy.<br /> The Latian king,
      unless he shall submit,<br /> Own his old promise, and his new forget-<br />
      Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove,<br /> And learn to fear whom
      he disdains to love.<br /> For such is Heav'n's command." The youthful
      prince<br /> With scorn replied, and made this bold defense:<br /> "You tell
      me, mother, what I knew before:<br /> The Phrygian fleet is landed on the
      shore.<br /> I neither fear nor will provoke the war;<br /> My fate is
      Juno's most peculiar care.<br /> But time has made you dote, and vainly
      tell<br /> Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell.<br /> Go; be the temple and
      the gods your care;<br /> Permit to men the thought of peace and war."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke,<br /> And frighted Turnus
      trembled as she spoke.<br /> Her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur
      burn;<br /> Her hideous looks and hellish form return;<br /> Her curling
      snakes with hissings fill the place,<br /> And open all the furies of her
      face:<br /> Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,<br /> She cast him
      backward as he strove to rise,<br /> And, ling'ring, sought to frame some
      new replies.<br /> High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,<br /> Her
      chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;<br /> And, churning bloody
      foam, thus loudly speaks:<br /> "Behold whom time has made to dote, and
      tell<br /> Of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell!<br /> Behold the Fates'
      infernal minister!<br /> War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus having said, her smold'ring torch, impress'd<br /> With her full
      force, she plung'd into his breast.<br /> Aghast he wak'd; and, starting
      from his bed,<br /> Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread.<br />
      "Arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare!"<br /> He breathes
      defiance, blood, and mortal war.<br /> So, when with crackling flames a
      caldron fries,<br /> The bubbling waters from the bottom rise:<br /> Above
      the brims they force their fiery way;<br /> Black vapors climb aloft, and
      cloud the day.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The peace polluted thus, a chosen band<br /> He first commissions to the
      Latian land,<br /> In threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest,<br /> To

      Lavinian shore,<br /> And Italy's indanger'd peace restore.<br /> Himself
      alone an equal match he boasts,<br /> To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian
      hosts.<br /> The gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare<br /> Their arms, and warn
      each other to the war.<br /> His beauty these, and those his blooming age,<br />

      While Turnus urges thus his enterprise,<br /> The Stygian Fury to the

      To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied<br /> His tender neck, and
      comb'd his silken hide,<br /> And bathed his body. Patient of command<br />
      In time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand,<br /> He waited at his master's
      board for food;<br /> Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood,<br />

      the floods,<br /> Possess'd with fear, and seeks his known abodes,<br /> His
      old familiar hearth and household gods.<br /> He falls; he fills the house
      with heavy groans,<br /> Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans.<br />
      Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud<br /> For succor from the
      clownish neighborhood:<br /> The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay<br />
      In the close woody covert, urg'd their way.<br /> One with a brand yet
      burning from the flame,<br /> Arm'd with a knotty club another came:<br />
      Whate'er they catch or find, without their care,<br /> Their fury makes an

      begins to rise,<br /> White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries;<br />
      Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies;<br /> Till, by the fury
      of the storm full blown,<br /> The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown.<br />
      First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care,<br /> Pierc'd with an arrow
      from the distant war:<br /> Fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood,<br />
      And stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood<br /> Huge heaps of slain
      around the body rise:<br /> Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies;<br /> A
      good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain,<br /> Amidst the madness of
      th' unruly train:<br /> Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures
      fill'd;<br /> His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood<br /> The Fury bath'd them
      in each other's blood;<br /> Then, having fix'd the fight, exulting flies,<br />
      And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies.<br /> To Juno thus she
      speaks: "Behold! It is done,<br /> The blood already drawn, the war begun;<br />
      The discord is complete; nor can they cease<br /> The dire debate, nor you
      command the peace.<br /> Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood<br />
      Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood;<br /> Speak, and my pow'r
      shall add this office more:<br /> The neighb'ing nations of th' Ausonian
      shore<br /> Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar,<br /> Of arm'd
      invasion, and embrace the war."<br /> Then Juno thus: "The grateful work is
      done,<br /> The seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun;<br /> Frauds, fears,
      and fury have possess'd the state,<br /> And fix'd the causes of a lasting
      hate.<br /> A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join<br /> Betwixt the Trojan
      and Ausonian line:<br /> But thou with speed to night and hell repair;<br />
      For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear<br /> Thy lawless wand'ring
      walks in upper air.<br /> Leave what remains to me." Saturnia said:<br />
      The sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd,<br /> Unwilling left the
      light, and sought the nether shade.<br />

      In midst of Italy, well known to fame,<br /> There lies a lake (Amsanctus
      is the name)<br /> Below the lofty mounts: on either side<br /> Thick
      forests the forbidden entrance hide.<br /> Full in the center of the sacred
      wood<br /> An arm arises of the Stygian flood,<br /> Which, breaking from
      beneath with bellowing sound,<br /> Whirls the black waves and rattling
      stones around.<br /> Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,<br />
      And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.<br /> To this infernal lake the
      Fury flies;<br /> Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies.<br />

      fear,<br /> In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,<br /> And lead his
      dances with dishevel'd hair,<br /> Increase the clamor, and the war demand,<br />
      (Such was Amata's interest in the land,)<br /> Against the public sanctions

      averse, the rout in arms resort,<br /> To force their monarch, and insult
      the court.<br /> But, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves<br /> The
      raging tempest and the rising waves-<br /> Propp'd on himself he stands;
      his solid sides<br /> Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides-<br />
      So stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long<br /> Sustain'd the madness of
      the noisy throng.<br /> But, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd,<br />
      And all the methods of cool counsel fail'd,<br /> He calls the gods to
      witness their offense,<br /> Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.<br />
      "Hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before<br /> A furious wind, we
      have the faithful shore.<br /> O more than madmen! you yourselves shall
      bear<br /> The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:<br /> Thou, Turnus,
      shalt atone it by thy fate,<br /> And pray to Heav'n for peace, but pray
      too late.<br /> For me, my stormy voyage at an end,<br /> I to the port of
      death securely tend.<br /> The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay,<br />
      Is all I want, and all you take away."<br /> He said no more, but, in his
      walls confin'd,<br /> Shut out the woes which he too well divin'd<br /> Nor
      with the rising storm would vainly strive,<br /> But left the helm, and let
      the vessel drive.<br />

      The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.<br /> Then, when the sacred senate
      votes the wars,<br /> The Roman consul their decree declares,<br /> And in
      his robes the sounding gates unbars.<br /> The youth in military shouts
      arise,<br /> And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.<br /> These

      the king refus'd,<br /> Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar<br />
      Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;<br /> But hid his head, and,
      safe from loud alarms,<br /> Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.<br />

      thy happy home, the clime where fate<br /> Ordains thee to restore the
      Trojan state.<br /> Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,<br /> And
      all the rage of haughty Juno cease.<br /> And that this nightly vision may
      not seem<br /> Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream,<br /> A sow beneath an
      oak shall lie along,<br /> All white herself, and white her thirty young.<br />
      When thirty rolling years have run their race,<br /> Thy son Ascanius, on
      this empty space,<br /> Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,<br />
      Which from this omen shall receive the name.<br /> Time shall approve the
      truth. For what remains,<br /> And how with sure success to crown thy
      pains,<br /> With patience next attend. A banish'd band,<br /> Driv'n with
      Evander from th' Arcadian land,<br /> Have planted here, and plac'd on high
      their walls;<br /> Their town the founder Pallanteum calls,<br /> Deriv'd
      from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name:<br /> But the fierce Latians old
      possession claim,<br /> With war infesting the new colony.<br /> These make
      thy friends, and on their aid rely.<br /> To thy free passage I submit my
      streams.<br /> Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;<br /> And, when
      the setting stars are lost in day,<br /> To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion
      pay;<br /> With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:<br /> Her pride at
      length shall fall, her fury cease.<br /> When thou return'st victorious
      from the war,<br /> Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.<br /> The god
      am I, whose yellow water flows<br /> Around these fields, and fattens as it
      goes:<br /> Tiber my name; among the rolling floods<br /> Renown'd on earth,
      esteem'd among the gods.<br /> This is my certain seat. In times to come,<br />
      My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome."<br />

      He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke,<br /> His dream Aeneas and
      his sleep forsook.<br /> He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies<br />
      With purple blushing, and the day arise.<br /> Then water in his hollow
      palm he took<br /> From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke:<br />
      "Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,<br /> And Father Tiber, in
      thy sacred bed<br /> Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.<br /> Whatever
      fount, whatever holy deep,<br /> Conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they
      rise,<br /> And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;<br /> Thou, king of
      horned floods, whose plenteous urn<br /> Suffices fatness to the fruitful
      corn,<br /> For this thy kind compassion of our woes,<br /> Shalt share my
      morning song and ev'ning vows.<br /> But, O be present to thy people's aid,<br />
      And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!"<br /> Thus having said, two
      galleys from his stores,<br /> With care he chooses, mans, and fits with
      oars.<br /> Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.<br /> Wondrous to
      tell!- She lay along the ground:<br /> Her well-fed offspring at her udders
      hung;<br /> She white herself, and white her thirty young.<br /> Aeneas
      takes the mother and her brood,<br /> And all on Juno's altar are bestow'd.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day,<br /> Propitious Tiber
      smooth'd his wat'ry way:<br /> He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he
      stood,<br /> A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.<br /> The Trojans
      mount their ships; they put from shore,<br /> Borne on the waves, and
      scarcely dip an oar.<br /> Shouts from the land give omen to their course,<br />
      And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force.<br /> The woods and waters
      wonder at the gleam<br /> Of shields, and painted ships that stem the
      stream.<br /> One summer's night and one whole day they pass<br /> Betwixt
      the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.<br /> The fiery sun had
      finish'd half his race,<br /> Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space,<br />
      When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs,<br /> The tops of sheds, and
      shepherds' lowly bow'rs,<br /> Thin as they stood, which, then of homely
      clay,<br /> Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.<br /> These cots
      (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor)<br /> The Trojan saw, and turn'd his
      ships to shore.<br /> 'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states,<br /> The
      king and prince, without the city gates,<br /> Then paid their off'rings in
      a sacred grove<br /> To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.<br /> Thick
      clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,<br /> And fat of entrails on his
      altar fries.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      But, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood,<br /> And glitter'd
      thro' the covert of the wood,<br /> They rose with fear, and left th'
      unfinish'd feast,<br /> Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest<br /> To
      pay the rites. Himself without delay<br /> A jav'lin seiz'd, and singly
      took his way;<br /> Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far:<br />
      "Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;<br /> Your bus'ness here;
      and bring you peace or war?"<br /> High on the stern Aeneas his stand,<br />
      And held a branch of olive in his hand,<br /> While thus he spoke: "The
      Phrygians' arms you see,<br /> Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy<br />
      By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;<br /> At first affianc'd, and at
      last betray'd.<br /> This message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief<br />
      Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.'<br /> Struck with so great a
      name, and all on fire,<br /> The youth replies: "Whatever you require,<br />
      Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.<br /> A welcome guest, and, what
      you wish, a friend."<br /> He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,<br />
      Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke<br /> The silence first, and thus the
      king bespoke:<br /> "Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command,<br /> I
      bear these peaceful branches in my hand,<br /> Undaunted I approach you,
      tho' I know<br /> Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;<br /> From
      Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came,<br /> And both the brother kings
      your kindred claim;<br /> Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,<br />
      Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown,<br /> Our fathers'
      mingled blood, Apollo's voice,<br /> Have led me hither, less by need than
      choice.<br /> Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,<br /> And Greeks
      acknowledge, from Electra sprung:<br /> Electra from the loins of Atlas
      came;<br /> Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.<br /> Your sire is
      Mercury, whom long before<br /> On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore.<br />
      Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,<br /> Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains
      the sky.<br /> Thus from one common source our streams divide;<br /> Ours is
      the Trojan, yours th' Arcadian side.<br /> Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no
      news before,<br /> Nor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore;<br />
      But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.<br /> The same Rutulians,
      who with arms pursue<br /> The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.<br /> Our
      host expell'd, what farther force can stay<br /> The victor troops from
      universal sway?<br /> Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land,<br />
      And either sea from side to side command.<br /> Receive our offer'd faith,
      and give us thine;<br /> Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line:<br /> We
      want not hearts nor bodies for the war;<br /> In council cautious, and in
      fields we dare."<br />

    <p class="poem">
      He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes<br /> Evander view'd the man
      with vast surprise,<br /> Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:<br />
      Then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:<br /> "O valiant leader of the
      Trojan line,<br /> In whom the features of thy father shine,<br /> How I
      recall Anchises! how I see<br /> His motions, mien, and all my friend, in
      thee!<br /> Long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind,<br /> When Priam to
      his sister's court design'd<br /> A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,<br />
      And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way.<br /> Then, past a boy, the
      callow down began<br /> To shade my chin, and call me first a man.<br /> I
      saw the shining train with vast delight,<br /> And Priam's goodly person
      pleas'd my sight:<br /> But great Anchises, far above the rest,<br /> With
      awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast.<br /> I long'd to join in
      friendship's holy bands<br /> Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual
      hands.<br /> I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,<br /> And, with a
      loving force, to Pheneus brought.<br /> He gave me, when at length
      constrain'd to go,<br /> A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,<br /> A vest
      embroider'd, glorious to behold,<br /> And two rich bridles, with their
      bits of gold,<br /> Which my son's coursers in obedience hold.<br /> The
      league you ask, I offer, as your right;<br /> And, when to-morrow's sun
      reveals the light,<br /> With swift supplies you shall be sent away.<br />
      Now celebrate with us this solemn day,<br /> Whose holy rites admit no long
      delay.<br /> Honor our annual feast; and take your seat,<br /> With friendly
      welcome, at a homely treat."<br /> Thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for
      fear)<br /> The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer.<br /> On sods
      of turf he set the soldiers round:<br /> A maple throne, rais'd higher from
      the ground,<br /> Receiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,<br /> A
      lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread.<br /> The loaves were serv'd
      in canisters; the wine<br /> In bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine:<br />
      Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      But when the rage of hunger was repress'd,<br /> Thus spoke Evander to his
      royal guest:<br /> "These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,<br />
      From no vain fears or superstition spring,<br /> Or blind devotion, or from
      blinder chance,<br /> Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;<br /> But, sav'd
      from danger, with a grateful sense,<br /> The labors of a god we
      recompense.<br /> See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,<br /> About
      whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;<br /> Such indigested ruin; bleak and
      bare,<br /> How desart now it stands, expos'd in air!<br /> 'T was once a
      robber's den, inclos'd around<br /> With living stone, and deep beneath the
      ground.<br /> The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,<br /> This hold,
      impervious to the sun, possess'd.<br /> The pavement ever foul with human
      gore;<br /> Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.<br /> Vulcan
      this plague begot; and, like his sire,<br /> Black clouds he belch'd, and
      flakes of livid fire.<br /> Time, long expected, eas'd us of our load,<br />
      And brought the needful presence of a god.<br /> Th' avenging force of
      Hercules, from Spain,<br /> Arriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain:<br />
      Thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain.<br /> His prize, the
      lowing herds, Alcides drove<br /> Near Tiber's bank, to graze the shady
      grove.<br /> Allur'd with hope of plunder, and intent<br /> By force to rob,
      by fraud to circumvent,<br /> The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray'd,<br />
      Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey'd;<br /> And, lest the printed
      footsteps might be seen,<br /> He dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den.<br />
      The tracks averse a lying notice gave,<br /> And led the searcher backward
      from the cave.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,<br /> To find fresh pasture
      and untrodden grass.<br /> The beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all
      around<br /> With bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound.<br /> One
      heifer, who had heard her love complain,<br /> Roar'd from the cave, and
      made the project vain.<br /> Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,<br />
      And toss'd about his head his knotted oak.<br /> Swift as the winds, or
      Scythian arrows' flight,<br /> He clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial
      height.<br /> Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;<br /> Fear his
      eyes, and paleness in his face,<br /> Confess'd the god's approach.
      Trembling he springs,<br /> As terror had increas'd his feet with wings;<br />
      Nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw<br /> His body, on his
      back the door he drew<br /> (The door, a rib of living rock; with pains<br />
      His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains):<br /> He broke the
      heavy links, the mountain clos'd,<br /> And bars and levers to his foe
      oppos'd.<br /> The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;<br /> The fierce
      avenger came with bounding haste;<br /> Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden
      hold,<br /> And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd.<br /> He gnash'd
      his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round<br /> With winged speed the
      circuit of the ground.<br /> Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in
      vain,<br /> And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.<br /> A pointed
      flinty rock, all bare and black,<br /> Grew gibbous from behind the
      mountain's back;<br /> Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,<br /> Here
      built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight.<br /> The leaning head
      hung threat'ning o'er the flood,<br /> And nodded to the left. The hero
      stood<br /> Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,<br /> Tugg'd at
      the solid stone with all his might.<br /> Thus heav'd, the fix'd
      foundations of the rock<br /> Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling
      shock.<br /> Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side<br /> The banks
      leap backward, and the streams divide;<br /> The sky shrunk upward with
      unusual dread,<br /> And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed.<br /> The
      court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight;<br /> The cavern glares with
      new-admitted light.<br /> So the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound,<br />
      Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;<br /> A sounding flaw
      succeeds; and, from on high,<br /> The gods with hate beheld the nether
      sky:<br /> The ghosts repine at violated night,<br /> And curse th' invading
      sun, and sicken at the sight.<br /> The graceless monster, caught in open
      day,<br /> Inclos'd, and in despair to fly away,<br /> Howls horrible from
      underneath, and fills<br /> His hollow palace with unmanly yells.<br /> The
      hero stands above, and from afar<br /> Plies him with darts, and stones,
      and distant war.<br /> He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires<br /> Black
      clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires,<br /> Gath'ring, with each
      repeated blast, the night,<br /> To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.<br />
      The wrathful god then plunges from above,<br /> And, where in thickest
      waves the sparkles drove,<br /> There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and
      gropes his way,<br /> Half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.<br />
      The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;<br /> He squeez'd his
      throat; he writh'd his neck around,<br /> And in a knot his crippled
      members bound;<br /> Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:<br />
      Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies.<br /> The doors, unbarr'd,
      receive the rushing day,<br /> And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd
      prey.<br /> The bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again.<br /> Next, by the
      feet, they drag him from his den.<br /> The wond'ring neighborhood, with
      glad surprise,<br /> Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,<br /> His
      mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd eyes.<br /> From that
      auspicious day, with rites divine,<br /> We worship at the hero's holy
      shrine.<br /> Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows:<br /> As priests,
      were added the Pinarian house,<br /> Who rais'd this altar in the sacred
      shade,<br /> Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid.<br /> For these
      deserts, and this high virtue shown,<br /> Ye warlike youths, your heads
      with garlands crown:<br /> Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,<br />
      And with deep draughts invoke our common god."<br />

    <p class="poem">
      This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd,<br /> And poplars black and

      The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.<br /> Meantime the sun
      descended from the skies,<br /> And the bright evening star began to rise.<br />
      And now the priests, Potitius at their head,<br /> In skins of beasts
      involv'd, the long procession led;<br /> Held high the flaming tapers in
      their hands,<br /> As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands;<br /> Then
      with a second course the tables load,<br /> And with full chargers offer to
      the god.<br /> The Salii sing, and cense his altars round<br /> With Saban
      smoke, their heads with poplar bound-<br /> One choir of old, another of
      the young,<br /> To dance, and bear the burthen of the song.<br /> The lay
      records the labors, and the praise,<br /> And all th' immortal acts of
      Hercules:<br /> First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands,<br /> The
      serpents strangled with his infant hands;<br /> Then, as in years and
      matchless force he grew,<br /> Th' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.<br />
      Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,<br /> Procur'd by Juno's and
      Eurystheus' hate:<br /> "Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue<br /> The
      cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:<br /> Nor thy resistless arm the
      bull withstood,<br /> Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.<br /> The
      triple porter of the Stygian seat,<br /> With lolling tongue, lay fawning
      at thy feet,<br /> And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat.<br /> Th'
      infernal waters trembled at thy sight;<br /> Thee, god, no face of danger
      could affright;<br /> Not huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake,<br />
      Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake.<br /> Hail, Jove's undoubted
      son! an added grace<br /> To heav'n and the great author of thy race!<br />
      Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay,<br /> And smile propitious on
      thy solemn day!"<br /> In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,<br /> The
      den and death of Cacus crown the feast.<br /> The woods to hollow vales
      convey the sound,<br /> The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.<br />
      The rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,<br /> The Trojan pass'd, the city
      to survey,<br /> And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way.<br /> The
      stranger cast around his curious eyes,<br /> New objects viewing still,
      with new surprise;<br /> With greedy joy enquires of various things,<br />
      And acts and monuments of ancient kings.<br /> Then thus the founder of the
      Roman tow'rs:<br /> "These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs,<br />
      Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took<br /> Their birth from
      trunks of trees and stubborn oak.<br /> Nor laws they knew, nor manners,
      nor the care<br /> Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share,<br /> Nor arts of
      gain, nor what they gain'd to spare.<br /> Their exercise the chase; the
      running flood<br /> Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.<br />
      Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove,<br /> Robb'd of his realms,
      and banish'd from above.<br /> The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he
      brought,<br /> And laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught,<br /> And Latium
      call'd the land where safe he lay<br /> From his unduteous son, and his
      usurping sway.<br /> With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;<br /> And
      hence the golden times deriv'd their name.<br /> A more degenerate and
      discolor'd age<br /> Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.<br /> Th'
      Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;<br /> And Saturn's empire often
      chang'd the name.<br /> Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,<br />
      With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd:<br /> For Tiber's flood was Albula
      before,<br /> Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore.<br /> I last
      arriv'd, driv'n from my native home<br /> By fortune's pow'r, and fate's
      resistless doom.<br /> Long toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land,<br />
      Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate,<br /> Since call'd
      Carmental by the Roman state;<br /> Where stood an altar, sacred to the
      name<br /> Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,<br /> Who to her son
      foretold th' Aenean race,<br /> Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place:<br />
      Then shews the forest, which, in after times,<br /> Fierce Romulus for
      perpetrated crimes<br /> A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine<br />
      Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:<br /> Then tells of Argus'
      death, his murder'd guest,<br /> Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.<br />
      Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;<br /> Now roof'd with gold,
      then thatch'd with homely reeds.<br /> A reverent fear (such superstition
      reigns<br /> Among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains.<br /> Some god,
      they knew- what god, they could not tell-<br /> Did there amidst the sacred
      horror dwell.<br /> Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw<br />
      The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe,<br /> Who took his shield, and
      dealt his bolts around,<br /> And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.<br />
      Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood<br /> Two stately towns, on
      either side the flood,)<br /> Saturnia's and Janicula's remains;<br /> And
      either place the founder's name retains.<br /> Discoursing thus together,
      they resort<br /> Where poor Evander kept his country court.<br /> They
      view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall;<br /> (Once oxen low'd, where
      now the lawyers bawl;)<br /> Then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they
      press'd,<br /> When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:<br /> "Mean as
      it is, this palace, and this door,<br /> Receiv'd Alcides, then a
      conqueror.<br /> Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,<br /> Which
      feasted him, and emulate a god."<br /> Then underneath a lowly roof he led<br />
      The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;<br /> The stuffing leaves, with
      hides of bears o'erspread.<br /> Now Night had shed her silver dews around,<br />
      And with her sable wings embrac'd the ground,<br /> When love's fair
      goddess, anxious for her son,<br /> (New tumults rising, and new wars
      begun,)<br /> Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed,<br /> With these
      alluring words invokes his aid;<br /> And, that her pleasing speech his
      mind may move,<br /> Inspires each accent with the charms of love:<br />
      "While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs,<br /> To level with the
      ground the Trojan tow'rs,<br /> I ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore,<br />
      Nor did the succor of thy skill implore;<br /> Nor urg'd the labors of my
      lord in vain,<br /> A sinking empire longer to sustain,<br /> Tho'much I
      ow'd to Priam's house, and more<br /> The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.<br />
      But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree,<br /> His race is doom'd to
      reign in Italy:<br /> With humble suit I beg thy needful art,<br /> O still
      propitious pow'r, that rules my heart!<br /> A mother kneels a suppliant
      for her son.<br /> By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won<br /> To forge
      impenetrable shields, and grace<br /> With fated arms a less illustrious
      race.<br /> Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd<br /> Against the
      relics of the Phrygian kind,<br /> With fire and sword my people to
      destroy,<br /> And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy."<br /> She said;
      and straight her arms, of snowy hue,<br /> About her unresolving husband
      threw.<br /> Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;<br /> His bones and
      marrow sudden warmth inspire;<br /> And all the godhead feels the wonted
      fire.<br /> Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,<br /> Or forky
      lightnings flash along the skies.<br /> The goddess, proud of her
      successful wiles,<br /> And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms,<br /> Panting, and half
      dissolving in her arms:<br /> "Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,<br />
      Or your own beauties or my love distrust?<br /> Long since, had you
      requir'd my helpful hand,<br /> Th' artificer and art you might command,<br />
      To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,<br /> Confin'd their empire to
      so short a date.<br /> And, if you now desire new wars to wage,<br /> My
      skill I promise, and my pains engage.<br /> Whatever melting metals can
      conspire,<br /> Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,<br /> Is freely
      yours: your anxious fears remove,<br /> And think no task is difficult to
      love."<br /> Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,<br /> He snatch'd
      the willing goddess to his arms;<br /> Till in her lap infus'd, he lay
      possess'd<br /> Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest.<br /> Now when
      the Night her middle race had rode,<br /> And his first slumber had
      refresh'd the god-<br /> The time when early housewives leave the bed;<br />
      When living embers on the hearth they spread,<br /> Supply the lamp, and
      call the maids to rise-<br /> With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd
      eyes,<br /> They ply the distaff by the winking light,<br /> And to their
      daily labor add the night:<br /> Thus frugally they earn their children's
      bread,<br /> And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed-<br /> Not less concern'd,
      nor at a later hour,<br /> Rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r.<br />

      Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,<br /> Betwixt Sicilia's coasts

      hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.<br /> The Cyclops here their heavy
      hammers deal;<br /> Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,<br /> Are
      heard around; the boiling waters roar,<br /> And smoky flames thro' fuming
      tunnels soar.<br /> Hether the Father of the Fire, by night,<br /> Thro' the
      brown air precipitates his flight.<br /> On their eternal anvils here he
      found<br /> The brethren beating, and the blows go round.<br /> A load of
      pointless thunder now there lies<br /> Before their hands, to ripen for the
      skies:<br /> These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;<br /> Consum'd on
      mortals with prodigious waste.<br /> Three rays of writhen rain, of fire
      three more,<br /> Of winged southern winds and cloudy store<br /> As many
      parts, the dreadful mixture frame;<br /> And fears are added, and avenging
      flame.<br /> Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair<br /> His broken axletrees
      and blunted war,<br /> And send him forth again with furbish'd arms,<br />
      To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms.<br /> The rest refresh the
      scaly snakes that fold<br /> The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.<br />

      in death, and with distorted face.<br />

      "My sons," said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside;<br /> Your strength and
      master-skill must now be tried.<br /> Arms for a hero forge; arms that
      require<br /> Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire."<br /> He
      said. They set their former work aside,<br /> And their new toils with
      eager haste divide.<br /> A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,<br />
      And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd;<br /> Of this, their artful
      hands a shield prepare,<br /> Alone sufficient to sustain the war.<br />
      Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close:<br /> One stirs the fire,
      and one the bellows blows.<br /> The hissing steel is in the smithy
      drown'd;<br /> The grot with beaten anvils groans around.<br /> By turns
      their arms advance, in equal time;<br /> By turns their hands descend, and
      hammers chime.<br /> They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;<br />
      The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs.<br />

      While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge<br /> Their labors thus, and
      ply th' Aeolian forge,<br /> The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes,<br />
      And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.<br /> He leaves his lowly bed:
      his buskins meet<br /> Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:<br /> He
      sets his trusty sword upon his side,<br /> And o'er his shoulder throws a
      panther's hide.<br /> Two menial dogs before their master press'd.<br />
      Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest.<br /> Mindful of
      promis'd aid, he mends his pace,<br /> But meets Aeneas in the middle
      space.<br /> Young Pallas did his father's steps attend,<br /> And true
      Achates waited on his friend.<br /> They join their hands; a secret seat
      they choose;<br /> Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews:<br />
      "Undaunted prince, I never can believe<br /> The Trojan empire lost, while
      you survive.<br /> Command th' assistance of a faithful friend;<br /> But
      feeble are the succors I can send.<br /> Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber
      bounds;<br /> That other side the Latian state surrounds,<br /> Insults our
      walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds.<br /> But mighty nations I prepare,
      to join<br /> Their arms with yours, and aid your just design.<br /> You
      come, as by your better genius sent,<br /> And fortune seems to favor your
      intent.<br /> Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,<br /> Of ancient
      building, and of high renown,<br /> Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian
      race,<br /> Who gave the name of Caere to the place,<br /> Once Agyllina
      call'd. It flourish'd long,<br /> In pride of wealth and warlike people
      strong,<br /> Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour,<br /> Assum'd the
      crown, with arbitrary pow'r.<br /> What words can paint those execrable
      times,<br /> The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes!<br /> That
      blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace<br /> On his own head, and on his
      impious race!<br /> The living and the dead at his command<br /> Were
      coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,<br /> Till, chok'd with stench, in
      loath'd embraces tied,<br /> The ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died.<br />
      Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more-<br /> The people's patience,
      tir'd, no longer bore<br /> The raging monster; but with arms beset<br />
      His house, and vengeance and destruction threat.<br /> They fire his
      palace: while the flame ascends,<br /> They force his guards, and execute
      his friends.<br /> He cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night,<br /> To
      Turnus' friendly court directs his flight.<br /> By just revenge the
      Tuscans set on fire,<br /> With arms, their king to punishment require:<br />
      Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand,<br /> My counsel shall
      submit to your command.<br /> Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry<br />
      To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.<br /> An ancient augur, skill'd
      in future fate,<br /> With these foreboding words restrains their hate:<br />
      'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r<br /> Of Tuscan youth, and
      choice of all their pow'r,<br /> Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,<br />
      To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms;<br /> Know this: no native of
      our land may lead<br /> This pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.'<br />
      Aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide,<br /> And wait with
      longing looks their promis'd guide.<br /> Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me
      has sent<br /> Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament:<br /> The people join
      their own with his desire;<br /> And all my conduct, as their king,
      require.<br /> But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,<br /> And
      age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,<br /> And a soul conscious of its
      own decay,<br /> Have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway.<br /> My Pallas
      were more fit to mount the throne,<br /> And should, but he's a Sabine
      mother's son,<br /> And half a native; but, in you, combine<br /> A manly
      vigor, and a foreign line.<br /> Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the
      way,<br /> Pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway.<br /> The staff of my
      declining days, my son,<br /> Shall make your good or ill success his own;<br />
      In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare,<br /> And serve the hard
      apprenticeship of war;<br /> Your matchless courage and your conduct view,<br />
      And early shall begin t' admire and copy you.<br /> Besides, two hundred
      horse he shall command;<br /> Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band.<br />
      These in my name are listed; and my son<br /> As many more has added in his
      own."<br />

      Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest,<br /> With downcast eyes, their

      Shook at the dismal prospect of the war.<br /> But his bright mother, from
      a breaking cloud,<br /> To cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud;<br />
      Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky,<br /> And Tyrrhene trumpets

      Aeneas only, conscious to the sign,<br /> Presag'd th' event, and joyful
      view'd, above,<br /> Th' accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love.<br />

      Stygian charms,<br /> Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd<br />
      Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood.<br /> Turnus shall dearly
      pay for faith forsworn;<br /> And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber

      Th' Arcadian king<br /> And Trojan youth the same oblations bring.<br />
      Next, of his men and ships he makes review;<br /> Draws out the best and

      If the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight;<br /> If we shall meet

      of arms, and shields, and shining war.<br /> The troops, drawn up in
      beautiful array,<br /> O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way.<br />

      Meantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms,<br /> Breaks thro' the

      her son,<br /> On the cool river's banks, retir'd alone.<br /> She shews her
      heav'nly form without disguise,<br /> And gives herself to his desiring

      Proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight<br /> Around the work, and
      gaz'd with vast delight.<br /> He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires<br />
      The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:<br /> His hands the fatal
      sword and corslet hold,<br /> One keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with
      gold:<br /> Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;<br /> So shines a
      cloud, when edg'd with adverse light.<br /> He shakes the pointed spear,
      and longs to try<br /> The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;<br /> But most
      admires the shield's mysterious mold,<br /> And Roman triumphs rising on
      the gold:<br /> For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought<br />
      (Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)<br /> The wars in order, and the
      race divine<br /> Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.<br /> The cave
      of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens:<br /> There, by the wolf, were laid
      the martial twins.<br /> Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;<br /> The
      foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue:<br /> They suck'd secure, while,
      bending back her head,<br /> She lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them
      as they fed.<br /> Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games<br />
      Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.<br /> The pit resounds with
      shrieks; a war succeeds,<br /> For breach of public faith, and unexampled
      deeds.<br /> Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;<br /> The Romans
      there with arms the prey defend.<br /> Wearied with tedious war, at length
      they cease;<br /> And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.<br />
      The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand,<br /> Both arm'd, with each
      a charger in his hand:<br /> A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,<br /> With
      imprecations on the perjur'd head.<br /> Near this, the traitor Metius,
      stretch'd between<br /> Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green,<br />
      By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood,<br /> And his torn limbs are
      left the vulture's food.<br /> There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,<br />
      And would by force restore the banish'd kings.<br /> One tyrant for his
      fellow-tyrant fights;<br /> The Roman youth assert their native rights.<br />
      Before the town the Tuscan army lies,<br /> To win by famine, or by fraud
      surprise.<br /> Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood,<br />
      While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.<br /> The captive
      maids there tempt the raging tide,<br /> Scap'd from their chains, with
      Cloelia for their guide.<br /> High on a rock heroic Manlius stood,<br /> To
      guard the temple, and the temple's god.<br /> Then Rome was poor; and there
      you might behold<br /> The palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with
      gold.<br /> The silver goose before the shining gate<br /> There flew, and,
      by her cackle, sav'd the state.<br /> She told the Gauls' approach; th'
      approaching Gauls,<br /> Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls.<br />
      The gold dissembled well their yellow hair,<br /> And golden chains on
      their white necks they wear.<br /> Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears
      they wield,<br /> And their left arm sustains a length of shield.<br /> Hard
      by, the leaping Salian priests advance;<br /> And naked thro' the streets
      the mad Luperci dance,<br /> In caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from
      heav'n.<br /> Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n,<br /> To pay
      their vows in solemn pomp appear,<br /> And odorous gums in their chaste
      hands they bear.<br /> Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen;<br />
      Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline<br /> Hung on a rock- the
      traitor; and, around,<br /> The Furies hissing from the nether ground.<br />
      Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,<br /> And Cato's holy ghost

      shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales.<br /> Aghast she looks, and
      heaves her breast for breath,<br /> Panting, and pale with fear of future
      death.<br /> The god had figur'd her as driv'n along<br /> By winds and
      waves, and scudding thro' the throng.<br /> Just opposite, sad Nilus opens
      wide<br /> His arms and ample bosom to the tide,<br /> And spreads his
      mantle o'er the winding coast,<br /> In which he wraps his queen, and hides
      the flying host.<br /> The victor to the gods his thanks express'd,<br />
      And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd.<br /> Three hundred
      temples in the town he plac'd;<br /> With spoils and altars ev'ry temple
      grac'd.<br /> Three shining nights, and three succeeding days,<br /> The
      fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,<br /> The domes with
      songs, the theaters with plays.<br /> All altars flame: before each altar
      lies,<br /> Drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice.<br /> Great Caesar
      sits sublime upon his throne,<br /> Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone;<br />
      Accepts the presents vow'd for victory,<br /> And hangs the monumental
      crowns on high.<br /> Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along,<br />
      Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue.<br /> Here, Mulciber assigns the
      proper place<br /> For Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race;<br /> Then
      ranks the Thracians in the second row,<br /> With Scythians, expert in the
      dart and bow.<br /> And here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides,<br /> And
      there the Rhine submits her swelling tides,<br /> And proud Araxes, whom no
      bridge could bind;<br /> The Danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind,<br />
      And Morini, the last of humankind.<br />

      These figures, on the shield divinely wrought,<br /> By Vulcan labor'd, and

    <h3>
      BOOK IX<br />
    </h3>
    <p class="poem">
      While these affairs in distant places pass'd,<br /> The various Iris Juno
      sends with haste,<br /> To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought,<br />
      The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.<br /> Retir'd alone she
      found the daring man,<br /> And op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:<br />
      "What none of all the gods could grant thy vows,<br /> That, Turnus, this
      auspicious day bestows.<br /> Aeneas, gone to seek th' Arcadian prince,<br />
      Has left the Trojan camp without defense;<br /> And, short of succors
      there, employs his pains<br /> In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.<br />
      Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs;<br /> Unite thy forces, and
      attack their lines."<br /> This said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight,<br />
      And form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes,<br /> And thus invokes the goddess
      as she flies:<br /> "Iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine<br /> Has
      sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine?<br /> See, they divide;
      immortal day appears,<br /> And glitt'ring planets dancing in their
      spheres!<br /> With joy, these happy omens I obey,<br /> And follow to the
      war the god that leads the way."<br /> Thus having said, as by the brook he
      stood,<br /> He scoop'd the water from the crystal flood;<br /> Then with
      his hands the drops to heav'n he throws,<br /> And loads the pow'rs above
      with offer'd vows.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain,<br /> Well hors'd, well
      clad; a rich and shining train.<br /> Messapus leads the van; and, in the
      rear,<br /> The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear.<br /> In the main
      battle, with his flaming crest,<br /> The mighty Turnus tow'rs above the
      rest.<br /> Silent they move, majestically slow,<br /> Like ebbing Nile, or
      Ganges in his flow.<br /> The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far,<br />
      And the dark menace of the distant war.<br /> Caicus from the rampire saw
      it rise,<br /> Black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies.<br />
      Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:<br /> "What rolling clouds, my
      friends, approach the walls?<br /> Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare
      your spears<br /> And pointed darts! the Latian host appears."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend<br /> The bulwarks,
      and, secure, their foes attend:<br /> For their wise gen'ral, with
      foreseeing care,<br /> Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war,<br />
      Nor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance,<br /> But close within their
      lines attend their chance.<br /> Unwilling, yet they keep the strict
      command,<br /> And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.<br /> The fiery
      Turnus flew before the rest:<br /> A piebald steed of Thracian strain he
      press'd;<br /> His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest.<br /> With
      twenty horse to second his designs,<br /> An unexpected foe, he fac'd the
      lines.<br /> "Is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare<br /> His
      leader's honor and his danger share?"<br /> Then spurring on, his
      brandish'd dart he threw,<br /> In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Amaz'd to find a dastard race, that run<br /> Behind the rampires and the
      battle shun,<br /> He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,<br /> And
      stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries.<br /> So roams the nightly
      wolf about the fold:<br /> Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with
      cold,<br /> He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,<br /> (His gnashing
      teeth are exercis'd in vain,)<br /> And, impotent of anger, finds no way<br />
      In his distended paws to grasp the prey.<br /> The mothers listen; but the
      bleating lambs<br /> Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.<br /> Thus
      ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain.<br /> Sharp with desire, and furious
      with disdain;<br /> Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,<br /> To
      force his foes in equal field to fight.<br /> Thus while he gazes round, at
      length he spies,<br /> Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies,<br />
      Close underneath the walls; the washing tide<br /> Secures from all
      approach this weaker side.<br /> He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his
      hand<br /> With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.<br /> Urg'd by his
      presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd,<br /> And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is
      arm'd.<br /> From the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly;<br /> Fat
      vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky.<br /> What pow'r, O Muses,
      could avert the flame<br /> Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan
      name?<br /> Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure,<br /> Is hard
      to faith; yet shall the fame endure.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight,<br /> And fell'd his
      timber from Mount Ida's height,<br /> The grandam goddess then approach'd
      her son,<br /> And with a mother's majesty begun:<br /> "Grant me," she
      said, "the sole request I bring,<br /> Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you
      for its king.<br /> On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood,<br /> With
      firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood;<br /> And on the summit rose a sacred
      grove,<br /> Where I was worship'd with religious love.<br /> Those woods,
      that holy grove, my long delight,<br /> I gave the Trojan prince, to speed
      his flight.<br /> Now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come;<br /> Let
      neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb<br /> The floating forests of the
      sacred pine;<br /> But let it be their safety to be mine."<br /> Then thus
      replied her awful son, who rolls<br /> The radiant stars, and heav'n and
      earth controls:<br /> "How dare you, mother, endless date demand<br /> For
      vessels molded by a mortal hand?<br /> What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas
      ride,<br /> Of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide?<br /> Yet, what I can,
      I grant; when, wafted o'er,<br /> The chief is landed on the Latian shore,<br />
      Whatever ships escape the raging storms,<br /> At my command shall change
      their fading forms<br /> To nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way,<br />
      Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea."<br /> To seal his sacred vow, by
      Styx he swore,<br /> The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,<br /> And
      Phlegethon's innavigable flood,<br /> And the black regions of his brother
      god.<br /> He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      And now at length the number'd hours were come,<br /> Prefix'd by fate's
      irrevocable doom,<br /> When the great Mother of the Gods was free<br /> To
      save her ships, and finish Jove's decree.<br /> First, from the quarter of
      the morn, there sprung<br /> A light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot
      along;<br /> Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires,<br /> Were
      timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;<br /> And, last, a voice, with
      more than mortal sounds,<br /> Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal
      horror wounds:<br /> "O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,<br /> And
      know, my ships are my peculiar care.<br /> With greater ease the bold
      Rutulian may,<br /> With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,<br /> Than
      singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,<br /> Loos'd from your crooked
      anchors, launch at large,<br /> Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,<br />
      And swim the seas, at Cybele's command."<br /> No sooner had the goddess
      ceas'd to speak,<br /> When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break;<br />
      And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main<br /> They plunge their
      prows, and dive, and spring again:<br /> As many beauteous maids the
      billows sweep,<br /> As rode before tall vessels on the deep.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast;<br /> Messapus curb'd his
      fiery courser's haste;<br /> Old Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head,<br />
      Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed.<br /> Turnus alone, undaunted,
      bore the shock,<br /> And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:<br />
      "These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant,<br /> And are by Jove for
      black presages sent.<br /> He takes the cowards' last relief away;<br /> For
      fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay,<br /> Must yield unfought, a
      base inglorious prey.<br /> The liquid half of all the globe is lost;<br />
      Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.<br /> Theirs is no more
      than that small spot of ground<br /> Which myriads of our martial men
      surround.<br /> Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.<br /> 'T was giv'n
      to Venus they should cross the seas,<br /> And land secure upon the Latian
      plains:<br /> Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains.<br /> 'T is
      in the fate of Turnus to destroy,<br /> With sword and fire, the faithless
      race of Troy.<br /> Shall such affronts as these alone inflame<br /> The
      Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?<br /> My cause and theirs is one; a
      fatal strife,<br /> And final ruin, for a ravish'd wife.<br /> Was 't not
      enough, that, punish'd for the crime,<br /> They fell; but will they fall a
      second time?<br /> One would have thought they paid enough before,<br /> To
      curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.<br /> Can they securely
      trust their feeble wall,<br /> A slight partition, a thin interval,<br />
      Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built<br /> By hands divine,
      yet perish'd by their guilt?<br /> Lend me, for once, my friends, your
      valiant hands,<br /> To force from out their lines these dastard bands.<br />
      Less than a thousand ships will end this war,<br /> Nor Vulcan needs his
      fated arms prepare.<br /> Let all the Tuscans, all th' Arcadians, join!<br />
      Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.<br /> Let them not fear
      the treasons of the night,<br /> The robb'd Palladium, the pretended
      flight:<br /> Our onset shall be made in open light.<br /> No wooden engine
      shall their town betray;<br /> Fires they shall have around, but fires by
      day.<br /> No Grecian babes before their camp appear,<br /> Whom Hector's
      arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year.<br /> Now, since the sun is rolling
      to the west,<br /> Give we the silent night to needful rest:<br /> Refresh
      your bodies, and your arms prepare;<br /> The morn shall end the small
      remains of war."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The post of honor to Messapus falls,<br /> To keep the nightly guard, to
      watch the walls,<br /> To pitch the fires at distances around,<br /> And
      close the Trojans in their scanty ground.<br /> Twice seven Rutulian
      captains ready stand,<br /> And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs
      command;<br /> All clad in shining arms the works invest,<br /> Each with a
      radiant helm and waving crest.<br /> Stretch'd at their length, they press
      the grassy ground;<br /> They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)<br />
      With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,<br /> And pass the wakeful
      night in feasts and play.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,<br /> And with arm'd legions
      all the rampires fill'd.<br /> Seiz'd with affright, their gates they first
      explore;<br /> Join works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r:<br /> Thus
      all things needful for defense abound.<br /> Mnestheus and brave Seresthus
      walk the round,<br /> Commission'd by their absent prince to share<br /> The
      common danger, and divide the care.<br /> The soldiers draw their lots,
      and, as they fall,<br /> By turns relieve each other on the wall.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,<br /> To watch the gate
      was warlike Nisus' chance.<br /> His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;<br />
      His mother was a huntress of the wood,<br /> And sent him to the wars. Well
      could he bear<br /> His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,<br /> But
      better skill'd unerring shafts to send.<br /> Beside him stood Euryalus,
      his friend:<br /> Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host<br /> No fairer face,
      or sweeter air, could boast-<br /> Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks
      begun.<br /> One was their care, and their delight was one:<br /> One common
      hazard in the war they shar'd,<br /> And now were both by choice upon the
      guard.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then Nisus thus: "Or do the gods inspire<br /> This warmth, or make we gods
      of our desire?<br /> A gen'rous ardor boils within my breast,<br /> Eager of
      action, enemy to rest:<br /> This urges me to fight, and fires my mind<br />
      To leave a memorable name behind.<br /> Thou see'st the foe secure; how
      faintly shine<br /> Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine<br />
      Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:<br /> The wakeful few the fuming
      flagon ply;<br /> All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve-<br /> A
      thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve.<br /> Our absent prince both camp
      and council mourn;<br /> By message both would hasten his return:<br /> If
      they confer what I demand on thee,<br /> (For fame is recompense enough for
      me,)<br /> Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied<br /> A way that safely
      will my passage guide."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke,<br /> With love of praise and
      noble envy struck;<br /> Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind:<br />
      "All this, alone, and leaving me behind!<br /> Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be
      join'd?<br /> Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield,<br /> Or send
      thee unassisted to the field?<br /> Not so my father taught my childhood
      arms;<br /> Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!<br /> Nor is my youth
      unworthy of my friend,<br /> Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend.<br /> The
      thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim,<br /> And think it over-sold
      to purchase fame."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then Nisus thus: "Alas! thy tender years<br /> Would minister new matter to
      my fears.<br /> So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,<br />
      Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life,<br /> Condemn'd to pay my vows,
      (as sure I trust,)<br /> This thy request is cruel and unjust.<br /> But if
      some chance- as many chances are,<br /> And doubtful hazards, in the deeds
      of war-<br /> If one should reach my head, there let it fall,<br /> And
      spare thy life; I would not perish all.<br /> Thy bloomy youth deserves a
      longer date:<br /> Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate;<br /> To bear
      my mangled body from the foe,<br /> Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites
      bestow.<br /> Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,<br /> Thou canst at
      least an empty tomb supply.<br /> O let not me the widow's tears renew!<br />
      Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue:<br /> Thy pious parent, who, for
      love of thee,<br /> Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,<br /> Her age
      committing to the seas and wind,<br /> When ev'ry weary matron stay'd
      behind."<br /> To this, Euryalus: "You plead in vain,<br /> And but protract
      the cause you cannot gain.<br /> No more delays, but haste!" With that, he
      wakes<br /> The nodding watch; each to his office takes.<br /> The guard
      reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went<br /> To find the council at the royal
      tent.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      All creatures else forgot their daily care,<br /> And sleep, the common
      gift of nature, share;<br /> Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate<br />
      In nightly council for th' indanger'd state.<br /> They vote a message to
      their absent chief,<br /> Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.<br />
      Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,<br /> Remote from clamor, and
      secure from foes.<br /> On their left arms their ample shields they bear,<br />
      The right reclin'd upon the bending spear.<br /> Now Nisus and his friend
      approach the guard,<br /> And beg admission, eager to be heard:<br /> Th'
      affair important, not to be deferr'd.<br /> Ascanius bids 'em be conducted
      in,<br /> Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin.<br /> Then Nisus thus: "Ye
      fathers, lend your ears;<br /> Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.<br />
      The foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine,<br /> Neglect their watch;
      the fires but thinly shine;<br /> And where the smoke in cloudy vapors
      flies,<br /> Cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies,<br /> Betwixt two
      paths, which at the gate divide,<br /> Close by the sea, a passage we have
      spied,<br /> Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.<br /> Expect each
      hour to see him safe again,<br /> Loaded with spoils of foes in battle
      slain.<br /> Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;<br /> Nor can we be
      mistaken in the way;<br /> For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen<br />
      The rising turrets, and the stream between,<br /> And know the winding
      course, with ev'ry ford."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      He ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word:<br /> "Our country gods, in whom
      our trust we place,<br /> Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,<br />
      While we behold such dauntless worth appear<br /> In dawning youth, and
      souls so void of fear."<br /> Then into tears of joy the father broke;<br />
      Each in his longing arms by turns he took;<br /> Panted and paus'd; and
      thus again he spoke:<br /> "Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,<br />
      In recompense of such desert, decree?<br /> The greatest, sure, and best
      you can receive,<br /> The gods and your own conscious worth will give.<br />
      The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow,<br /> And young Ascanius till
      his manhood owe."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "And I, whose welfare in my father lies,"<br /> Ascanius adds, "by the
      great deities,<br /> By my dear country, by my household gods,<br /> By
      hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes,<br /> Adjure you both, (on you my
      fortune stands;<br /> That and my faith I plight into your hands,)<br />
      Make me but happy in his safe return,<br /> Whose wanted presence I can
      only mourn;<br /> Your common gift shall two large goblets be<br /> Of
      silver, wrought with curious imagery,<br /> And high emboss'd, which, when
      old Priam reign'd,<br /> My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd;<br />
      And more, two tripods cast in antic mold,<br /> With two great talents of
      the finest gold;<br /> Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art,<br /> Which
      Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.<br /> But, if in conquer'd Italy
      we reign,<br /> When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain-<br /> Thou
      saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd:<br /> That, Nisus, and his
      arms, and nodding crest,<br /> And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy
      share:<br /> Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair<br />
      All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care;<br /> And, last, a Latian
      field with fruitful plains,<br /> And a large portion of the king's
      domains.<br /> But thou, whose years are more to mine allied-<br /> No fate
      my vow'd affection shall divide<br /> From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly
      mine;<br /> Take full possession; all my soul is thine.<br /> One faith, one
      fame, one fate, shall both attend;<br /> My life's companion, and my bosom
      friend:<br /> My peace shall be committed to thy care,<br /> And to thy
      conduct my concerns in war."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then thus the young Euryalus replied:<br /> "Whatever fortune, good or bad,
      betide,<br /> The same shall be my age, as now my youth;<br /> No time shall
      find me wanting to my truth.<br /> This only from your goodness let me gain<br />
      (And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)<br /> Of Priam's royal race my
      mother came-<br /> And sure the best that ever bore the name-<br /> Whom
      neither Troy nor Sicily could hold<br /> From me departing, but, o'erspent
      and old,<br /> My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this<br /> (Whatever)
      danger, neither parting kiss,<br /> Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,<br />
      And in this only act of all my life deceive.<br /> By this right hand and
      conscious Night I swear,<br /> My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.<br />
      Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place<br /> (Permit me to presume so
      great a grace)<br /> Support her age, forsaken and distress'd.<br /> That
      hope alone will fortify my breast<br /> Against the worst of fortunes, and
      of fears."<br /> He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears.<br />

      Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see<br /> That image of his filial
      piety:<br /> "So great beginnings, in so green an age,<br /> Exact the faith
      which I again ingage.<br /> Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,<br />
      Creusa had, and only want the name.<br /> Whate'er event thy bold attempt
      shall have,<br /> 'T is merit to have borne a son so brave.<br /> Now by my

      He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,<br /> From his broad belt he
      drew a shining sword,<br /> Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,<br /> And in
      an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.<br /> This was his gift. Great
      Mnestheus gave his friend<br /> A lion's hide, his body to defend;<br /> And
      good Alethes furnish'd him, beside,<br /> With his own trusty helm, of

      Thus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait<br /> Their issuing forth, and
      follow to the gate<br /> With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears<br />
      Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,<br /> And messages committed to their

      The trenches first they pass'd; then took their way<br /> Where their proud
      foes in pitch'd pavilions lay;<br /> To many fatal, ere themselves were
      slain.<br /> They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain,<br />
      Who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.<br /> Unharness'd
      chariots stand along the shore:<br /> Amidst the wheels and reins, the
      goblet by,<br /> A medley of debauch and war, they lie.<br /> Observing
      Nisus shew'd his friend the sight:<br /> "Behold a conquest gain'd without
      a fight.<br /> Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd;<br /> There lies our
      way; be thou upon the guard,<br /> And look around, while I securely go,<br />
      And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe."<br /> Softly he spoke; then
      striding took his way,<br /> With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes
      lay;<br /> His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath,<br /> And heaving from
      his breast, he drew his breath;<br /> A king and prophet, by King Turnus
      lov'd:<br /> But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd.<br /> Him and his
      sleeping slaves he slew; then spies<br /> Where Remus, with his rich
      retinue, lies.<br /> His armor-bearer first, and next he kills<br /> His
      charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels<br /> And his lov'd horses; last
      invades their lord;<br /> Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:<br />
      The gasping head flies off; a purple flood<br /> Flows from the trunk, that
      welters in the blood,<br /> Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around,<br />
      The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.<br /> Lamus the bold, and
      Lamyrus the strong,<br /> He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.<br />
      From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest,<br /> And puff'd the fumy god
      from out his breast:<br /> Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play-<br />
      More lucky, had it lasted till the day.<br /> The famish'd lion thus, with
      hunger bold,<br /> O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,<br /> And tears
      the peaceful flocks: with silent awe<br /> Trembling they lie, and pant
      beneath his paw.<br />

      Nor with less rage Euryalus employs<br /> The wrathful sword, or fewer foes
      destroys;<br /> But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew;<br /> He Fadus,

      Nisus observ'd the discipline, and said:<br /> "Our eager thirst of blood

      The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd.<br /> Of arms, and arras, and of

      Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay<br /> To make the rich

      Nor did his eyes less longingly behold<br /> The girdle-belt, with nails of
      burnish'd gold.<br /> This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd<br /> On

      Messapus' helm he finds among the rest,<br /> And laces on, and wears the

      But far they had not pass'd, before they spied<br /> Three hundred horse,
      with Volscens for their guide.<br /> The queen a legion to King Turnus
      sent;<br /> But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,<br /> And now,
      advancing, sought the leader's tent.<br /> They saw the pair; for, thro'
      the doubtful shade,<br /> His shining helm Euryalus betray'd,<br /> On which
      the moon with full reflection play'd.<br /> "'T is not for naught," cried
      Volscens from the crowd,<br /> "These men go there;" then rais'd his voice
      aloud:<br /> "Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?<br /> From
      whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?"<br /> Silent they scud away, and
      haste their flight<br /> To neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to
      night.<br /> The speedy horse all passages belay,<br /> And spur their
      smoking steeds to cross their way,<br /> And watch each entrance of the
      winding wood.<br /> Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,<br />
      Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;<br /> Few paths of human feet,
      or tracks of beasts, were worn.<br /> The darkness of the shades, his heavy
      prey,<br /> And fear, misled the younger from his way.<br /> But Nisus hit
      the turns with happier haste,<br /> And, thoughtless of his friend, the
      forest pass'd,<br /> And Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd,<br />
      Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd;<br /> Till, turning at the
      length, he stood his ground,<br /> And miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes
      around:<br /> "Ah wretch!" he cried, "where have I left behind<br /> Th'
      unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?<br /> Or what way take?" Again
      he ventures back,<br /> And treads the mazes of his former track.<br /> He
      winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise<br /> Of tramping coursers,
      and the riders' voice.<br /> The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd<br />
      The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,<br /> Forelaid and taken, while
      he strove in vain<br /> The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.<br />
      What should he next attempt? what arms employ,<br /> What fruitless force,
      to free the captive boy?<br /> Or desperate should he rush and lose his
      life,<br /> With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife?<br />

      Resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook;<br /> And, casting on the
      moon a mournful look:<br /> "Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,<br />
      Fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright.<br /> If e'er my pious
      father, for my sake,<br /> Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make,<br />
      Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils,<br /> And hung thy holy roofs
      with savage spoils,<br /> Give me to scatter these." Then from his ear<br />
      He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear.<br /> The deadly
      weapon, hissing from the grove,<br /> Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;<br />
      Pierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital blood,<br /> And in his body left
      the broken wood.<br /> He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,<br />
      And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.<br /> All stand amaz'd- a
      second jav'lin flies<br /> With equal strength, and quivers thro' the
      skies.<br /> This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way,<br /> And in the
      brainpan warmly buried lay.<br /> Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and,
      gazing round,<br /> Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,<br /> Nor
      knew to fix revenge: "But thou," he cries,<br /> "Shalt pay for both," and
      at the pris'ner flies<br /> With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep
      despair,<br /> That cruel sight the lover could not bear;<br /> But from his
      covert rush'd in open view,<br /> And sent his voice before him as he flew:<br />
      "Me! me!" he cried- "turn all your swords alone<br /> On me- the fact
      confess'd, the fault my own.<br /> He neither could nor durst, the
      guiltless youth:<br /> Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!<br />
      His only crime (if friendship can offend)<br /> Is too much love to his
      unhappy friend."<br /> Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,<br />
      Driv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides.<br /> Down fell the
      beauteous youth: the yawning wound<br /> Gush'd out a purple stream, and
      stain'd the ground.<br /> His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,<br />
      Like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd;<br /> Like a white poppy
      sinking on the plain,<br /> Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain.<br />
      Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd,<br /> Drove Nisus headlong
      on the hostile crowd.<br /> Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:<br />
      Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends,<br /> Onward he press'd,
      and kept him still in sight;<br /> Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all
      his might:<br /> Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke,<br /> Piered
      his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke.<br /> Dying, he slew; and,
      stagg'ring on the plain,<br /> With swimming eyes he sought his lover
      slain;<br /> Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,<br /> Content, in death,
      to be reveng'd so well.<br />

      casting from their tow'rs a frightful view,<br /> They saw the faces, which
      too well they knew,<br /> Tho' then disguis'd in death, and smear'd all
      o'er<br /> With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore.<br /> Soon hasty
      fame thro' the sad city bears<br /> The mournful message to the mother's
      ears.<br /> An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes;<br /> Her cheeks the

      the war,<br /> Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair,<br /> And
      fills with loud laments the liquid air.<br /> "Thus, then, my lov'd

      went,<br /> In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!<br /> Cold on the
      ground, and pressing foreign clay,<br /> To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a
      prey!<br /> Nor was I near to close his dying eyes,<br /> To wash his

      friends,<br /> Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)<br /> On his dear
      body, which I wove with care,<br /> Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor
      spare.<br /> Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains<br /> His
      trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains?<br /> For this, alas! I left my
      needful ease,<br /> Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas!<br /> If any
      pity touch Rutulian hearts,<br /> Here empty all your quivers, all your
      darts;<br /> Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe,<br /> And send
      me thunderstruck to shades below!"<br /> Her shrieks and clamors pierce the
      Trojans' ears,<br /> Unman their courage, and augment their fears;<br /> Nor

      they eat, nor taste unconquer'd food.<br /> No sports, but what belong to
      war, they know:<br /> To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow.<br /> Our
      youth, of labor patient, earn their bread;<br /> Hardly they work, with
      frugal diet fed.<br /> From plows and harrows sent to seek renown,<br />
      They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town.<br /> No part of life from
      toils of war is free,<br /> No change in age, or diff'rence in degree.<br />
      We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel,<br /> Instead of goads, the spur
      and pointed steel;<br /> Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain.<br />
      Ev'n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain:<br /> The body, not
      the mind; nor can control<br /> Th' immortal vigor, or abate the soul.<br />
      Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray:<br /> We live by plunder,
      and delight in prey.<br /> Your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine;<br />
      In sloth you glory, and in dances join.<br /> Your vests have sweeping
      sleeves; with female pride<br /> Your turbants underneath your chins are
      tied.<br /> Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again!<br /> Go, less than
      women, in the shapes of men!<br /> Go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's
      rites,<br /> Where with unequal sound the flute invites;<br /> Sing, dance,
      and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade:<br /> Resign the war to men, who know
      the martial trade!"<br />

      This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear<br /> With patience, or a vow'd
      revenge forbear.<br /> At the full stretch of both his hands he drew,<br />
      And almost join'd the horns of the tough yew.<br /> But, first, before the
      throne of Jove he stood,<br /> And thus with lifted hands invok'd the god:<br />
      "My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed!<br /> An annual off'ring in thy
      grove shall bleed;<br /> A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,<br />
      Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,<br /> Butts with his

      spurns the yellow sands."<br />

      his temples forc'd the way:<br /> Extended on the ground, Numanus lay.<br />
      "Go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn!<br /> The Phrygians, twice

      Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,<br /> To view the feats of arms, and
      fighting crowd;<br /> And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:<br />
      "Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,<br /> And wide from east to
      west extend thy name;<br /> Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe<br />
      To thee a race of demigods below.<br /> This is the way to heav'n: the

      to them, and their victorious heirs,<br /> The conquer'd war is due, and
      the vast world is theirs.<br /> Troy is too narrow for thy name." He said,<br />
      And plunging downward shot his radiant head;<br /> Dispell'd the breathing
      air, that broke his flight:<br /> Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal
      sight.<br /> Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire,<br /> Now left, to
      rule Ascanius, by his sire:<br /> His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,<br />
      His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,<br /> And thus salutes the
      boy, too forward for his years:<br /> "Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy
      son,<br /> The warlike prize thou hast already won.<br /> The god of archers
      gives thy youth a part<br /> Of his own praise, nor envies equal art.<br />
      Now tempt the war no more." He said, and flew<br /> Obscure in air, and
      vanish'd from their view.<br /> The Trojans, by his arms, their patron
      know,<br /> And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow.<br /> Then duteous
      force they use, and Phoebus' name,<br /> To keep from fight the youth too
      fond of fame.<br /> Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;<br /> From
      wall to wall the shouts and clamors run.<br /> They bend their bows; they
      whirl their slings around;<br /> Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the
      ground;<br /> And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.<br /> The
      combat thickens, like the storm that flies<br /> From westward, when the
      show'ry Kids arise;<br /> Or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main,<br />
      When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain,<br /> Or bellowing clouds burst
      with a stormy sound,<br /> And with an armed winter strew the ground.<br />

      th' attack, and, to prevent their fate,<br /> Runs where the giant brothers
      guard the gate.<br /> The first he met, Antiphates the brave,<br /> But
      base-begotten on a Theban slave,<br /> Sarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly

      in his vital blood.<br /> Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies,<br /> And

      A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw,<br /> Rough in the rind, and

      two.<br /> Down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound:<br /> His pond'rous
      limbs oppress the trembling ground;<br /> Blood, brains, and foam gush from
      the gaping wound:<br /> Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides,<br />
      And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides.<br /> The Trojans fly from

      Gyges died;<br /> Then Phalaris is added to his side.<br /> The pointed

      the prince:<br /> But weak his force, and vain is their defense.<br />
      Turn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew,<br /> And at one blow the
      bold aggressor slew.<br /> He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so
      strong,<br /> The helm flies off, and bears the head along.<br /> Next him,
      the huntsman Amycus he kill'd,<br /> In darts invenom'd and in poison
      skill'd.<br /> Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear,<br /> And Creteus,

      The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief,<br /> Their slaughter'd

      save the living, and revenge the dead,<br /> Against one warrior's arms all
      Troy they led.<br /> "O, void of sense and courage!" Mnestheus cried,<br />
      "Where can you hope your coward heads to hide?<br /> Ah! where beyond these
      rampires can you run?<br /> One man, and in your camp inclos'd, you shun!<br />
      Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast,<br /> And pass unpunish'd
      from a num'rous host?<br /> Forsaking honor, and renouncing fame,<br /> Your

      Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,<br /> But with slow paces

      advance the more,<br /> And tread in ev'ry step he trod before.<br /> They

      vain he presses on,<br /> Nor will his courage let him dare to run:<br /> So
      Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,<br /> Moves tardy back, and just
      recedes from fight.<br /> Yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews,<br />
      Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.<br /> But now they swarm,
      and, with fresh troops supplied,<br /> Come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry
      side:<br /> Nor Juno, who sustain'd his arms before,<br /> Dares with new

      Then thus to both replied th' imperial god,<br /> Who shakes heav'n's axles

      With rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command:<br /> The clouds dispel;
      the winds their breath restrain;<br /> And the hush'd waves lie flatted on
      the main.)<br /> "Celestials, your attentive ears incline!<br /> Since,"
      said the god, "the Trojans must not join<br /> In wish'd alliance with the
      Latian line;<br /> Since endless jarrings and immortal hate<br /> Tend but
      to discompose our happy state;<br /> The war henceforward be resign'd to
      fate:<br /> Each to his proper fortune stand or fall;<br /> Equal and
      unconcern'd I look on all.<br /> Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me;<br />
      And both shall draw the lots their fates decree.<br /> Let these assault,
      if Fortune be their friend;<br /> And, if she favors those, let those
      defend:<br /> The Fates will find their way." The Thund'rer said,<br /> And
      shook the sacred honors of his head,<br /> Attesting Styx, th' inviolable
      flood,<br /> And the black regions of his brother god.<br /> Trembled the
      poles of heav'n, and earth confess'd the nod.<br /> This end the sessions
      had: the senate rise,<br /> And to his palace wait their sov'reign thro'
      the skies.<br />

      Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies.<br /> A choir of Nereids meet
      him on the flood,<br /> Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood;<br />
      But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep,<br /> As rode, before, tall
      vessels on the deep.<br /> They know him from afar; and in a ring<br />
      Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king.<br /> Cymodoce, whose voice
      excell'd the rest,<br /> Above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast;<br />
      Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides<br /> The curling ocean,
      and corrects the tides.<br /> She spoke for all the choir, and thus began<br />
      With pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man:<br /> "Sleeps our lov'd

      shore, we fled his fires profane<br /> (Unwillingly we broke our master's
      chain),<br /> And since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main.<br /> The
      mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these,<br /> And gave us life immortal
      in the seas.<br /> But young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd,<br /> By your
      insulting foes is hardly press'd.<br /> Th' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian
      host,<br /> Advance in order on the Latian coast:<br /> To cut their way the
      Daunian chief designs,<br /> Before their troops can reach the Trojan
      lines.<br /> Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,<br /> First arm
      thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:<br /> Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan
      wield,<br /> And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield.<br /> To-morrow's sun,
      unless my skill be vain,<br /> Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle
      slain."<br /> Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force<br /> Push'd on
      the vessel in her wat'ry course;<br /> For well she knew the way. Impell'd
      behind,<br /> The ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind.<br /> The
      rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,<br /> The chief admires their speed,
      and happy omens draws.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes:<br /> "Hear thou, great

      Fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.)<br /> Firm thy own omens;

      flags to follow, and their arms prepare;<br /> Warn'd of th' ensuing fight,
      and bade 'em hope the war.<br /> Now, his lofty poop, he view'd below<br />
      His camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe.<br /> His blazing shield,
      imbrac'd, he held on high;<br /> The camp receive the sign, and with loud
      shouts reply.<br /> Hope arms their courage: from their tow'rs they throw<br />
      Their darts with double force, and drive the foe.<br /> Thus, at the signal
      giv'n, the cranes arise<br /> Before the stormy south, and blacken all the

      King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd,<br /> Till, looking back, the

      far, with dazzled eyes,<br /> The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to
      rise,<br /> And dart diffusive fires around the field,<br /> And the keen
      glitt'ring of the golden shield.<br /> Thus threat'ning comets, when by
      night they rise,<br /> Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies:<br />
      So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights,<br /> Pale humankind with
      plagues and with dry famine fright:<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent<br /> To man the shores, and hinder
      their descent,<br /> And thus awakes the courage of his friends:<br /> "What
      you so long have wish'd, kind Fortune sends;<br /> In ardent arms to meet
      th' invading foe:<br /> You find, and find him at advantage now.<br /> Yours
      is the day: you need but only dare;<br /> Your swords will make you masters
      of the war.<br /> Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,<br />
      And dearest wifes, are all within your hands.<br /> Be mindful of the race
      from whence you came,<br /> And emulate in arms your fathers' fame.<br />
      Now take the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand<br /> With feet unfirm,
      and prepossess the strand:<br /> Fortune befriends the bold." Nor more he
      said,<br /> But balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead;<br /> Then these
      elects, the landing to prevent;<br /> And those he leaves, to keep the city
      pent.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:<br /> Some are by boats
      expos'd, by bridges more.<br /> With lab'ring oars they bear along the
      strand,<br /> Where the tide languishes, and leap aland.<br /> Tarchon
      observes the coast with careful eyes,<br /> And, where no ford he finds, no
      water fries,<br /> Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,<br /> But smoothly
      slide along, and swell the shore,<br /> That course he steer'd, and thus he
      gave command:<br /> "Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:<br /> Force
      on the vessel, that her keel may wound<br /> This hated soil, and furrow
      hostile ground.<br /> Let me securely land- I ask no more;<br /> Then sink
      my ships, or shatter on the shore."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:<br /> They tug at ev'ry
      oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends;<br /> They run their ships aground; the
      vessels knock,<br /> (Thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock.<br />
      Tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood,<br /> Stuck on a bank, and
      beaten by the flood:<br /> She breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give
      way,<br /> And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.<br /> Their broken
      oars and floating planks withstand<br /> Their passage, while they labor to
      the land,<br /> And ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,<br /> Advancing to the margin of
      the sea.<br /> The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail'd<br /> The clowns

      the fight;<br /> Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height.<br /> He
      first in open field defied the prince:<br /> But armor scal'd with gold was
      no defense<br /> Against the fated sword, which open'd wide<br /> His plated

      others born,<br /> Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn;<br />
      Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee;<br /> For his beginning life
      from biting steel was free.<br /> Not far from him was Gyas laid along,<br />
      Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong:<br /> Vain bulk and
      strength! for, when the chief assail'd,<br /> Nor valor nor Herculean arms
      avail'd,<br /> Nor their fam'd father, wont in war to go<br /> With great
      Alcides, while he toil'd below.<br /> The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his
      death:<br /> Aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath.<br />
      Then wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom,<br /> Who courted Clytius in his
      beardless bloom,<br /> And sought with lust obscene polluted joys:<br /> The
      Trojan sword had curd his love of boys,<br /> Had not his sev'n bold
      brethren stopp'd the course<br /> Of the fierce champions, with united
      force.<br /> Sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound<br /> From
      his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:<br /> The rest had reach'd
      him; but his mother's care<br /> Prevented those, and turn'd aside in air.<br />

      The prince then call'd Achates, to supply<br /> The spears that knew the

      in vain<br /> Against our foes, on this contended plain."<br /> He said;
      then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw;<br /> Which, wing'd with fate, thro'
      Maeon's buckler flew,<br /> Pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his
      heart:<br /> He stagger'd with intolerable smart.<br /> Alcanor saw; and
      reach'd, but reach'd in vain,<br /> His helping hand, his brother to
      sustain.<br /> A second spear, which kept the former course,<br /> From the
      same hand, and sent with equal force,<br /> His right arm pierc'd, and
      holding on, bereft<br /> His use of both, and pinion'd down his left.<br />
      Then Numitor from his dead brother drew<br /> Th' ill-omen'd spear, and at

      In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,<br /> And, from afar, at Dryops

      pierc'd his throat, directed at his face;<br /> It stopp'd at once the
      passage of his wind,<br /> And the free soul to flitting air resign'd:<br />
      His forehead was the first that struck the ground;<br /> Lifeblood and life
      rush'd mingled thro' the wound.<br /> He slew three brothers of the Borean
      race,<br /> And three, whom Ismarus, their native place,<br /> Had sent to
      war, but all the sons of Thrace.<br /> Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci
      leads:<br /> The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,<br /> Conspicuous on
      his horse. On either hand,<br /> These fight to keep, and those to win, the

      roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n<br /> Stands without motion, and the tide
      undriv'n:<br /> Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,<br /> They long

      we must come;<br /> There lies our way, and that our passage home.<br /> Nor
      pow'rs above, nor destinies below<br /> Oppress our arms: with equal
      strength we go,<br /> With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe.<br /> See on
      what foot we stand: a scanty shore,<br /> The sea behind, our enemies
      before;<br /> No passage left, unless we swim the main;<br /> Or, forcing
      these, the Trojan trenches gain."<br /> This said, he strode with eager
      haste along,<br /> And bore amidst the thickest of the throng.<br /> Lagus,
      the first he met, with fate to foe,<br /> Had heav'd a stone of mighty
      weight, to throw:<br /> Stooping, the spear descended on his chine,<br />
      Just where the bone distinguished either loin:<br /> It stuck so fast, so
      deeply buried lay,<br /> That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away.<br />
      Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow<br /> To wish'd revenge, the
      prince prevents his blow;<br /> For, warding his at once, at once he
      press'd,<br /> And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast.<br /> Then lewd
      Anchemolus he laid in dust,<br /> Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with
      impious lust.<br /> And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,<br />
      Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;<br /> So wondrous like in feature,
      shape, and size,<br /> As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes-<br />
      Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides<br /> The nice distinction,
      and their fate divides:<br /> For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris'
      hand,<br /> Dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand:<br /> The trembling

      laid him dead:<br /> Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound,<br /> And
      intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground.<br /> As when, in summer, welcome
      winds arise,<br /> The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,<br /> And
      fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,<br /> And catching flames
      infect the neighb'ring heads;<br /> Around the forest flies the furious
      blast,<br /> And all the leafy nation sinks at last,<br /> And Vulcan rides
      in triumph o'er the waste;<br /> The pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory,<br />
      Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:<br /> So Pallas'
      troops their scatter'd strength unite,<br /> And, pouring on their foes,
      their prince delight.<br />

      Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains,<br /> With two white steeds; but
      Liger holds the reins,<br /> And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains:<br />
      Bold brethren both. The former wav'd in air<br /> His flaming sword: Aeneas
      couch'd his spear,<br /> Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear.<br />

      the Trojan plain:<br /> Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,<br />
      Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;<br /> Nor Venus' veil is here,
      near Neptune's shield;<br /> Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."<br />
      Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer<br /> Return'd his answer with
      his flying spear.<br /> As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,<br /> Prone
      to the wheels, and his left foot protends,<br /> Prepar'd for fight; the
      fatal dart arrives,<br /> And thro' the borders of his buckler drives;<br />
      Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound,<br /> Cast from his
      chariot, roll'd him on the ground.<br /> Whom thus the chief upbraids with
      scornful spite:<br /> "Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;<br />
      Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;<br /> But you yourself
      forsake your empty seat."<br /> He said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd

      or themselves, alone,<br /> With inborn valor force their fortune on?<br />
      How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!<br /> Judge if such warriors
      want immortal aid."<br /> To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,<br />
      Soft in her tone, submissively replies:<br /> "Why, O my sov'reign lord,
      whose frown I fear,<br /> And cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear;<br />
      Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still<br /> (As once I was) were
      mistress of your will,<br /> From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife<br />
      Might gain the grace of length'ning Turnus' life,<br /> Securely snatch him
      from the fatal fight,<br /> And give him to his aged father's sight.<br />
      Now let him perish, since you hold it good,<br /> And glut the Trojans with
      his pious blood.<br /> Yet from our lineage he derives his name,<br /> And,
      in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;<br /> Yet he devoutly pays
      you rites divine,<br /> And offers daily incense at your shrine."<br />

      You beg reprieve for this expiring man,<br /> I grant you leave to take
      your Turnus hence<br /> From instant fate, and can so far dispense.<br />
      But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,<br /> To save the short-liv'd
      youth from destin'd death,<br /> Or if a farther thought you entertain,<br />
      To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."<br /> To whom the
      goddess thus, with weeping eyes:<br /> "And what if that request, your
      tongue denies,<br /> Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,<br />
      But length of certain life, to Turnus give?<br /> Now speedy death attends
      the guiltless youth,<br /> If my presaging soul divines with truth;<br />
      Which, O! I wish, might err thro' causeless fears,<br /> And you (for you
      have pow'r) prolong his years!"<br />

      aloft; a plumy crest he wore;<br /> This hand appear'd a shining sword to
      wield,<br /> And that sustain'd an imitated shield.<br /> With manly mien he
      stalk'd along the ground,<br /> Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting
      sound.<br /> (Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,<br /> Or dreadful
      visions in our dreams by night.)<br /> The specter seems the Daunian chief
      to dare,<br /> And flourishes his empty sword in air.<br /> At this,
      advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear:<br /> The phantom wheel'd, and seem'd
      to fly for fear.<br /> Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,<br /> And
      with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.<br /> "Whether, O coward?" (thus he
      calls aloud,<br /> Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,)<br />
      "Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me<br /> The fated land you
      sought so long by sea."<br /> He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,<br />
      With eager pace pursued the flying shade.<br /> By chance a ship was
      fasten'd to the shore,<br /> Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:<br />
      The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;<br /> For shelter there the
      trembling shadow bent,<br /> And skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches
      went.<br /> Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,<br /> Ascends the plank,
      and to the galley pass'd.<br /> Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's
      hand<br /> The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.<br /> With wind
      in poop, the vessel plows the sea,<br /> And measures back with speed her
      former way.<br /> Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,<br /> And sends his
      slaughter'd troops to shades below.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,<br /> And flew sublime, and
      vanish'd in a cloud.<br /> Too late young Turnus the delusion found,<br />
      Far on the sea, still making from the ground.<br /> Then, thankless for a
      life redeem'd by shame,<br /> With sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame,<br />
      Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd,<br /> His hands and haggard
      eyes to heav'n he cast;<br /> "O Jove!" he cried, "for what offense have<br />
      Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy?<br /> Whence am I forc'd, and whether
      am I borne?<br /> How, and with what reproach, shall I return?<br /> Shall
      ever I behold the Latian plain,<br /> Or see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs
      again?<br /> What will they say of their deserting chief<br /> The war was
      mine: I fly from their relief;<br /> I led to slaughter, and in slaughter
      leave;<br /> And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive.<br /> Here,
      overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie;<br /> There, scatter'd o'er the
      fields, ignobly fly.<br /> Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!<br />
      Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!<br /> On sands or shelves the
      splitting vessel drive;<br /> Or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore,<br />
      Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,<br /> Unknown to friends, or foes,

      Thus Turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd:<br /> The choice was
      doubtful, but the death resolv'd.<br /> And now the sword, and now the sea

      Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,<br /> By stretch of arms the

      as he fled.<br /> At Latagus a weighty stone he flung:<br /> His face was
      flatted, and his helmet rung.<br /> But Palmus from behind receives his
      wound;<br /> Hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground:<br /> His
      crest and armor, from his body torn,<br /> Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy
      head adorn.<br /> Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew.<br /> Mimas his
      birth from fair Theano drew,<br /> Born on that fatal night, when, big with
      fire,<br /> The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire:<br /> But Paris in
      the Phrygian fields was slain,<br /> Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.<br />

      From Coritus came Acron to the fight,<br /> Who left his spouse betroth'd,
      and unconsummate night.<br /> Mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride,<br />
      Proud of the purple favors of his bride.<br /> Then, as a hungry lion, who
      beholds<br /> A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,<br /> Or beamy
      stag, that grazes on the plain-<br /> He runs, he roars, he shakes his
      rising mane,<br /> He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;<br /> The prey
      lies panting underneath his paws:<br /> He fills his famish'd maw; his
      mouth runs o'er<br /> With unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore:<br />
      So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,<br /> And first unhappy Acron
      overthrows:<br /> Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;<br />
      The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound.<br /> Then with
      disdain the haughty victor view'd<br /> Orodes flying, nor the wretch
      pursued,<br /> Nor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound,<br /> But,
      running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground:<br /> Then turning short, he
      met him face to face,<br /> To give his victor the better grace.<br />
      Orodes falls, in equal fight oppress'd:<br /> Mezentius fix'd his foot upon
      his breast,<br /> And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:<br /> "Lo! here
      the champion of my rebels lies!"<br /> The fields around with Io Paean!
      ring;<br /> And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king.<br /> At this
      the vanquish'd, with his dying breath,<br /> Thus faintly spoke, and
      prophesied in death:<br /> "Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain:<br />
      Like death attends thee on this fatal plain."<br /> Then, sourly smiling,
      thus the king replied:<br /> "For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;<br />
      But die thou first, whatever chance ensue."<br /> He said, and from the
      wound the weapon drew.<br /> A hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight,<br />
      And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night.<br />

      Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,<br /> Brandish'd his spear,

      first with careful eyes<br /> The space his spear could reach, aloud he

      (Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)<br /> His armor, from the Trojan

      stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said:<br /> "Poor hapless youth!
      what praises can be paid<br /> To love so great, to such transcendent store<br />
      Of early worth, and sure presage of more?<br /> Accept whate'er Aeneas can
      afford;<br /> Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword;<br /> And all that
      pleas'd thee living, still remain<br /> Inviolate, and sacred to the slain.<br />
      Thy body on thy parents I bestow,<br /> To rest thy soul, at least, if
      shadows know,<br /> Or have a sense of human things below.<br /> There to
      thy fellow ghosts with glory tell:<br /> ''T was by the great Aeneas hand I
      fell.'"<br /> With this, his distant friends he beckons near,<br /> Provokes
      their duty, and prevents their fear:<br /> Himself assists to lift him from

    <p class="poem">
      Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,<br /> And wash'd his wounds by
      Tiber's yellow flood:<br /> Oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent,<br />
      His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.<br /> A bough his brazen helmet
      did sustain;<br /> His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain:<br /> A
      chosen train of youth around him stand;<br /> His drooping head was rested
      on his hand:<br /> His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;<br /> And all
      on Lausus ran his restless thought.<br /> Careful, concern'd his danger to
      prevent,<br /> He much enquir'd, and many a message sent<br /> To warn him
      from the field- alas! in vain!<br /> Behold, his mournful followers bear
      him slain!<br /> O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound,<br />
      And drew a bloody trail along the ground.<br /> Far off he heard their
      cries, far off divin'd<br /> The dire event, with a foreboding mind.<br />
      With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;<br /> Then both his lifted
      hands to heav'n he spread;<br /> Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he
      said:<br /> "What joys, alas! could this frail being give,<br /> That I have
      been so covetous to live?<br /> To see my son, and such a son, resign<br />
      His life, a ransom for preserving mine!<br /> And am I then preserv'd, and
      art thou lost?<br /> How much too dear has that redemption cost!<br /> 'T is
      now my bitter banishment I feel:<br /> This is a wound too deep for time to
      heal.<br /> My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;<br /> My blackness
      blotted thy unblemish'd name.<br /> Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and
      exil'd<br /> For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:<br /> I ow'd my
      people these, and, from their hate,<br /> With less resentment could have
      borne my fate.<br /> And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight<br /> Of
      hated men, and of more hated light:<br /> But will not long." With that he
      rais'd from ground<br /> His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound;<br />
      Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd<br /> With pains or perils, for
      his courser call'd<br /> Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress<br />
      With daily care, and mounted with success;<br /> His aid in arms, his
      ornament in peace.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,<br /> The steed seem'd sensible,
      while thus he spoke:<br /> "O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me-<br />
      If life and long were terms that could agree!<br /> This day thou either
      shalt bring back the head<br /> And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;<br />
      This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,<br /> For murther'd Lausus, on
      his cruel foe;<br /> Or, if inexorable fate deny<br /> Our conquest, with
      thy conquer'd master die:<br /> For, after such a lord, I rest secure,<br />
      Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure."<br /> He said; and
      straight th' officious courser kneels,<br /> To take his wonted weight. His
      hands he fills<br /> With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd<br /> His
      glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd<br /> With waving horsehair,
      nodding from afar;<br /> Then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war.<br />
      Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,<br /> Despair, and
      secret shame, and conscious thought<br /> Of inborn worth, his lab'ring
      soul oppress'd,<br /> Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast.<br />
      Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name:<br /> The loud repeated voice to
      glad Aeneas came.<br /> "Great Jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god,<br />
      Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!"<br /> He spoke no more; but
      hasten'd, void of fear,<br /> And threaten'd with his long protended spear.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      To whom Mezentius thus: "Thy vaunts are vain.<br /> My Lausus lies extended
      on the plain:<br /> He's lost! thy conquest is already won;<br /> The
      wretched sire is murther'd in the son.<br /> Nor fate I fear, but all the
      gods defy.<br /> Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die;<br /> But first
      receive this parting legacy."<br /> He said; and straight a whirling dart
      he sent;<br /> Another after, and another went.<br /> Round in a spacious
      ring he rides the field,<br /> And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield.<br />
      Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd,<br /> Turn'd as he turn'd:
      the golden orb withstood<br /> The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.<br />
      Impatient of delay, and weary grown,<br /> Still to defend, and to defend
      alone,<br /> To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,<br /> Urg'd and
      o'er-labor'd in unequal fight;<br /> At length resolv'd, he throws with all
      his force<br /> Full at the temples of the warrior horse.<br /> Just where
      the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear<br /> Made way, and stood
      transfix'd thro' either ear.<br /> Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd
      with fright,<br /> The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright,<br />
      Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind<br /> Spring up in air aloft,
      and lash the wind.<br /> Down comes the rider headlong from his height:<br />
      His horse came after with unwieldy weight,<br /> And, flound'ring forward,
      pitching on his head,<br /> His lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      From either host, the mingled shouts and cries<br /> Of Trojans and
      Rutulians rend the skies.<br /> Aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword<br />
      High o'er his head, with this reproachful word:<br /> "Now; where are now
      thy vaunts, the fierce disdain<br /> Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty
      strain?"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,<br /> With scarce recover'd
      sight he thus replies:<br /> "Why these insulting words, this waste of
      breath,<br /> To souls undaunted, and secure of death?<br /> 'T is no
      dishonor for the brave to die,<br /> Nor came I here with hope victory;<br />
      Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design:<br /> As I had us'd my
      fortune, use thou thine.<br /> My dying son contracted no such band;<br />
      The gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand.<br /> For this, this only
      favor let me sue,<br /> If pity can to conquer'd foes be due:<br /> Refuse
      it not; but let my body have<br /> The last retreat of humankind, a grave.<br />
      Too well I know th' insulting people's hate;<br /> Protect me from their
      vengeance after fate:<br /> This refuge for my poor remains provide,<br />
      And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side."<br /> He said, and to the sword
      his throat applied.<br /> The crimson stream distain'd his arms around,<br />
      And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.<br />

      Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,<br /> Where, new in death,
      lamented Pallas lay.<br /> Acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd<br />

      Deplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began:<br /> "Unhappy youth! when
      Fortune gave the rest<br /> Of my full wishes, she refus'd the best!<br />
      She came; but brought not thee along, to bless<br /> My longing eyes, and
      share in my success:<br /> She grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due<br />
      To prosp'rous valor, in the public view.<br /> Not thus I promis'd, when
      thy father lent<br /> Thy needless succor with a sad consent;<br /> Embrac'd
      me, parting for th' Etrurian land,<br /> And sent me to possess a large
      command.<br /> He warn'd, and from his own experience told,<br /> Our foes
      were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold.<br /> And now perhaps, in hopes of thy
      return,<br /> Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,<br /> While we, with
      vain officious pomp, prepare<br /> To send him back his portion of the war,<br />
      A bloody breathless body, which can owe<br /> No farther debt, but to the
      pow'rs below.<br /> The wretched father, ere his race is run,<br /> Shall
      view the fun'ral honors of his son.<br /> These are my triumphs of the
      Latian war,<br /> Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!<br /> And
      yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see<br /> A son whose death disgrac'd his
      ancestry;<br /> Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:<br /> Thy
      Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd.<br /> He died no death to make thee
      wish, too late,<br /> Thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:<br />
      But what a champion has th' Ausonian coast,<br /> And what a friend hast
      thou, Ascanius, lost!"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,<br /> To raise the breathless

      His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,<br /> To bear him back and share
      Evander's grief:<br /> A well-becoming, but a weak relief.<br /> Of oaken
      twigs they twist an easy bier,<br /> Then on their shoulders the sad burden
      rear.<br /> The body on this rural hearse is borne:<br /> Strew'd leaves and
      funeral greens the bier adorn.<br /> All pale he lies, and looks a lovely
      flow'r,<br /> New cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r:<br /> Unfaded
      yet, but yet unfed below,<br /> No more to mother earth or the green stern
      shall owe.<br /> Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,<br /> Of
      purple woven, and with gold emboss'd,<br /> For ornament the Trojan hero
      brought,<br /> Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.<br /> One vest
      array'd the corpse; and one they spread<br /> O'er his clos'd eyes, and
      wrapp'd around his head,<br /> That, when the yellow hair in flame should
      fall,<br /> The catching fire might burn the golden caul.<br /> Besides, the
      spoils of foes in battle slain,<br /> When he descended on the Latian
      plain;<br /> Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led<br /> In long
      array- th' achievements of the dead.<br /> Then, pinion'd with their hands
      behind, appear<br /> Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear,<br />
      Appointed off'rings in the victor's name,<br /> To sprinkle with their
      blood the fun'ral flame.<br /> Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;<br />
      Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;<br /> And fair inscriptions
      fix'd, and titles read<br /> Of Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead.<br />

      Acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends,<br /> With feeble steps, supported
      by his friends.<br /> Pausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd,<br />
      Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;<br /> Where grov'ling while he
      lies in deep despair,<br /> He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.<br />
      The champion's chariot next is seen to roll,<br /> Besmear'd with hostile
      blood, and honorably foul.<br /> To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of
      state,<br /> Is led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait.<br /> Stripp'd of his
      trappings, with a sullen pace<br /> He walks; and the big tears run rolling
      down his face.<br /> The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,<br /> Are
      borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest.<br /> The march begins: the
      trumpets hoarsely sound;<br /> The pikes and lances trail along the ground.<br />
      Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse<br /> To Pallantean tow'rs direct
      their course,<br /> In long procession rank'd, the pious chief<br /> Stopp'd
      in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:<br /> "The public care," he said,
      "which war attends,<br /> Diverts our present woes, at least suspends.<br />
      Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!<br /> Hail, holy relics! and a
      last farewell!"<br /> He said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd,<br />
      Restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand<br /> A truce, with olive
      branches in their hand;<br /> Obtest his clemency, and from the plain<br />
      Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.<br /> They plead, that none
      those common rites deny<br /> To conquer'd foes that in fair battle die.<br />
      All cause of hate was ended in their death;<br /> Nor could he war with
      bodies void of breath.<br /> A king, they hop'd, would hear a king's
      request,<br /> Whose son he once was call'd, and once his guest.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Their suit, which was too just to be denied,<br /> The hero grants, and
      farther thus replied:<br /> "O Latian princes, how severe a fate<br /> In
      causeless quarrels has involv'd your state,<br /> And arm'd against an
      unoffending man,<br /> Who sought your friendship ere the war began!<br />
      You beg a truce, which I would gladly give,<br /> Not only for the slain,
      but those who live.<br /> I came not hither but by Heav'n's command,<br />
      And sent by fate to share the Latian land.<br /> Nor wage I wars unjust:
      your king denied<br /> My proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride;<br />
      Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try<br /> His cause in arms, to
      conquer or to die.<br /> My right and his are in dispute: the slain<br />
      Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.<br /> In equal arms let us
      alone contend;<br /> And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.<br />
      This is the way (so tell him) to possess<br /> The royal virgin, and
      restore the peace.<br /> Bear this message back, with ample leave,<br />
      That your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd,<br /> Stood mute a while, and on
      each other gaz'd.<br /> Drances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast<br />
      Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd,<br /> Broke silence first, and
      to the godlike man,<br /> With graceful action bowing, thus began:<br />
      "Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,<br /> But yet whose actions far
      transcend your fame;<br /> Would I your justice or your force express,<br />
      Thought can but equal; and all words are less.<br /> Your answer we shall
      thankfully relate,<br /> And favors granted to the Latian state.<br /> If
      wish'd success our labor shall attend,<br /> Think peace concluded, and the
      king your friend:<br /> Let Turnus leave the realm to your command,<br />
      And seek alliance in some other land:<br /> Build you the city which your
      fates assign;<br /> We shall be proud in the great work to join."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade<br /> The rest impower'd, that
      soon a truce is made.<br /> Twelve days the term allow'd: and, during
      those,<br /> Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,<br /> Mix'd in the
      woods, for fun'ral piles prepare<br /> To fell the timber, and forget the
      war.<br /> Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;<br /> Oak, mountain
      ash, and poplar spread the ground;<br /> First fall from high; and some the
      trunks receive<br /> In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      And now the fatal news by Fame is blown<br /> Thro' the short circuit of
      th' Arcadian town,<br /> Of Pallas slain- by Fame, which just before<br />
      His triumphs on distended pinions bore.<br /> Rushing from out the gate,
      the people stand,<br /> Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.<br />
      Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:<br /> The fields are lighten'd
      with a fiery blaze,<br /> That cast a sullen splendor on their friends,<br />
      The marching troop which their dead prince attends.<br /> Both parties
      meet: they raise a doleful cry;<br /> The matrons from the walls with
      shrieks reply,<br /> And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky.<br />
      The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,<br /> Till the loud clamors
      reach Evander's ears:<br /> Forgetful of his state, he runs along,<br />
      With a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;<br /> Falls on the corpse;
      and groaning there he lies,<br /> With silent grief, that speaks but at his
      eyes.<br /> Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks<br /> A
      passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,<br /> To fight with caution,
      not to tempt the sword!<br /> I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew<br />
      What perils youthful ardor would pursue,<br /> That boiling blood would
      carry thee too far,<br /> Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!<br /> O
      curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,<br /> Prelude of bloody fields, and
      fights to come!<br /> Hard elements of unauspicious war,<br /> Vain vows to
      Heav'n, and unavailing care!<br /> Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my
      bed,<br /> Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,<br /> Praescious of
      ills, and leaving me behind,<br /> To drink the dregs of life by fate
      assign'd!<br /> Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:<br /> My Pallas late
      set out, but reach'd too soon.<br /> If, for my league against th' Ausonian
      state,<br /> Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,<br /> (Deserv'd from
      them,) then I had been return'd<br /> A breathless victor, and my son had
      mourn'd.<br /> Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,<br /> Nor grudge th'
      alliance I so gladly made.<br /> 'T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so
      young,<br /> But my own crime, for having liv'd too long.<br /> Yet, since
      the gods had destin'd him to die,<br /> At least he led the way to victory:<br />
      First for his friends he won the fatal shore,<br /> And sent whole herds of
      slaughter'd foes before;<br /> A death too great, too glorious to deplore.<br />
      Nor will I add new honors to thy grave,<br /> Content with those the Trojan
      hero gave:<br /> That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd,<br /> In
      which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd.<br /> Great spoils and trophies,
      gain'd by thee, they bear:<br /> Then let thy own achievements be thy
      share.<br /> Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,<br /> Whose mighty
      trunk had better grac'd the wood,<br /> If Pallas had arriv'd, with equal
      length<br /> Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.<br /> But why,
      unhappy man, dost thou detain<br /> These troops, to view the tears thou
      shedd'st in vain?<br /> Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:<br />
      Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,<br /> And, after Pallas' death,
      live ling'ring on,<br /> 'T is to behold his vengeance for my son.<br /> I
      stay for Turnus, whose devoted head<br /> Is owing to the living and the
      dead.<br /> My son and I expect it from his hand;<br /> 'T is all that he
      can give, or we demand.<br /> Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,<br />
      To greet my Pallas with such news below."<br />

    <p class="poem">
      The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night,<br /> Restoring toils, when
      she restor'd the light.<br /> The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command<br />
      To raise the piles along the winding strand.<br /> Their friends convey the
      dead fun'ral fires;<br /> Black smold'ring smoke from the green wood
      expires;<br /> The light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires.<br />
      Then thrice around the kindled piles they go<br /> (For ancient custom had
      ordain'd it so)<br /> Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;<br />
      And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.<br /> Tears, trickling
      down their breasts, bedew the ground,<br /> And drums and trumpets mix
      their mournful sound.<br /> Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw<br />
      The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:<br /> Helms, bits emboss'd, and
      swords of shining steel;<br /> One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;<br />
      Some to their fellows their own arms restore:<br /> The fauchions which in
      luckless fight they bore,<br /> Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts
      bestow'd in vain,<br /> And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain.<br />
      Whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire,<br /> And bristled boars, and
      woolly sheep expire.<br /> Around the piles a careful troop attends,<br />
      To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;<br />
      Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night<br /> New decks the face of
      heav'n with starry light.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      The conquer'd Latians, with like pious care,<br /> Piles without number for
      their dead prepare.<br /> Part in the places where they fell are laid;<br />
      And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd.<br /> The corps of kings,
      and captains of renown,<br /> Borne off in state, are buried in the town;<br />
      The rest, unhonor'd, and without a name,<br /> Are cast a common heap to
      feed the flame.<br /> Trojans and Latians vie with like desires<br /> To
      make the field of battle shine with fires,<br /> And the promiscuous blaze
      to heav'n aspires.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Now had the morning thrice renew'd the light,<br /> And thrice dispell'd

      yet warm ashes from below;<br /> These, and the bones unburn'd, in earth
      bestow;<br /> These relics with their country rites they grace,<br /> And
      raise a mount of turf to mark the place.<br />

      But, in the palace of the king, appears<br /> A scene more solemn, and a

      Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons.<br /> All in that
      universal sorrow share,<br /> And curse the cause of this unhappy war:<br />
      A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,<br /> A crown usurp'd, which with
      their blood is bought!<br /> These are the crimes with which they load the
      name<br /> Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:<br /> "Let him who lords it
      o'er th' Ausonian land<br /> Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand:<br /> His
      is the gain; our lot is but to serve;<br /> 'T is just, the sway he seeks,

      "His foe expects, and dares him to the fight."<br /> Nor Turnus wants a
      party, to support<br /> His cause and credit in the Latian court.<br /> His

      When Venulus began, the murmuring sound<br /> Was hush'd, and sacred

      with joy,<br /> The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy.<br /> When
      introduc'd, our presents first we bring,<br /> Then crave an instant
      audience from the king.<br /> His leave obtain'd, our native soil we name,<br />
      And tell th' important cause for which we came.<br /> Attentively he heard
      us, while we spoke;<br /> Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look,<br />
      Made this return: 'Ausonian race, of old<br /> Renown'd for peace, and for
      an age of gold,<br /> What madness has your alter'd minds possess'd,<br />
      To change for war hereditary rest,<br /> Solicit arms unknown, and tempt
      the sword,<br /> A needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd?<br /> We- for
      myself I speak, and all the name<br /> Of Grecians, who to Troy's
      destruction came,<br /> Omitting those who were in battle slain,<br /> Or
      borne by rolling Simois to the main-<br /> Not one but suffer'd, and too
      dearly bought<br /> The prize of honor which in arms he sought;<br /> Some
      doom'd to death, and some in exile driv'n.<br /> Outcasts, abandon'd by the
      care of Heav'n;<br /> So worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew,<br /> As

      Restor'd to scepters, and expell'd again?<br /> Or young Achilles, by his
      rival slain?<br /> Ev'n he, the King of Men, the foremost name<br /> Of all

      inferior in the field,<br /> In pious reverence to the gods excell'd.<br />
      Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care<br /> Th' impending dangers of
      a fatal war.'<br /> He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,<br />

      Thus Venulus concluded his report.<br /> A jarring murmur fill'd the

    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty throne<br /> The king invok'd the
      gods, and thus begun:<br /> "I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate<br /> Had
      been resolv'd before it was too late.<br /> Much better had it been for you
      and me,<br /> Unforc'd by this our last necessity,<br /> To have been
      earlier wise, than now to call<br /> A council, when the foe surrounds the
      wall.<br /> O citizens, we wage unequal war,<br /> With men not only
      Heav'n's peculiar care,<br /> But Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the
      field,<br /> Or, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield.<br /> What hopes you
      had in Diomedes, lay down:<br /> Our hopes must center on ourselves alone.<br />
      Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,<br /> You see too well; nor
      need my words explain.<br /> Vanquish'd without resource; laid flat by
      fate;<br /> Factions within, a foe without the gate!<br /> Not but I grant
      that all perform'd their parts<br /> With manly force, and with undaunted
      hearts:<br /> With our united strength the war we wag'd;<br /> With equal
      numbers, equal arms, engag'd.<br /> You see th' event.- Now hear what I
      propose,<br /> To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.<br /> A tract of
      land the Latins have possess'd<br /> Along the Tiber, stretching to the
      west,<br /> Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,<br /> And their mix'd
      cattle graze the fruitful hill.<br /> Those mountains fill'd with firs,
      that lower land,<br /> If you consent, the Trojan shall command,<br />
      Call'd into part of what is ours; and there,<br /> On terms agreed, the
      common country share.<br /> There let'em build and settle, if they please;<br />
      Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,<br /> In search of seats
      remote from Italy,<br /> And from unwelcome inmates set us free.<br /> Then
      twice ten galleys let us build with speed,<br /> Or twice as many more, if
      more they need.<br /> Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood<br /> Runs
      equal with the margin of the flood:<br /> Let them the number and the form
      assign;<br /> The care and cost of all the stores be mine.<br /> To treat
      the peace, a hundred senators<br /> Shall be commission'd hence with ample
      pow'rs,<br /> With olive the presents they shall bear,<br /> A purple robe,
      a royal iv'ry chair,<br /> And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs
      wear,<br /> And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate<br /> This great
      affair, and save the sinking state."<br />

      the fight,<br /> And sought his safety in ignoble flight.<br /> Now, best of
      kings, since you propose to send<br /> Such bounteous presents to your
      Trojan friend;<br /> Add yet a greater at our joint request,<br /> One which
      he values more than all the rest:<br /> Give him the fair Lavinia for his
      bride;<br /> With that alliance let the league be tied,<br /> And for the
      bleeding land a lasting peace provide.<br /> Let insolence no longer awe
      the throne;<br /> But, with a father's right, bestow your own.<br /> For
      this maligner of the general good,<br /> If still we fear his force, he
      must be woo'd;<br /> His haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore,<br /> Your
      scepter to release, and our just rights restore.<br /> O cursed cause of
      all our ills, must we<br /> Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!<br />
      What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,<br /> And send us out to
      meet our certain fate?<br /> 'T is a destructive war: from Turnus' hand<br />
      Our peace and public safety we demand.<br /> Let the fair bride to the
      brave chief remain;<br /> If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.<br />
      Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,<br /> Nor will I much with
      your belief contend:<br /> I beg your greatness not to give the law<br /> In
      others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw.<br /> Pity your own, or pity our
      estate;<br /> Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.<br /> Your
      interest is, the war should never cease;<br /> But we have felt enough to
      wish the peace:<br /> A land exhausted to the last remains,<br />
      Depopulated towns, and driven plains.<br /> Yet, if desire of fame, and
      thirst of pow'r,<br /> A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r,<br /> So
      fire your mind, in arms assert your right,<br /> And meet your foe, who
      dares you to the fight.<br /> Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;<br />
      We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:<br /> A base ignoble crowd,
      without a name,<br /> Unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame,<br /> By duty
      bound to forfeit each his life,<br /> That Turnus may possess a royal wife.<br />
      Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew<br /> Should share such triumphs,
      and detain from you<br /> The post of honor, your undoubted due.<br />
      Rather alone your matchless force employ,<br /> To merit what alone you
      must enjoy."<br />

      These words, so full of malice mix'd with art,<br /> Inflam'd with rage the
      youthful hero's heart.<br /> Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast,<br />
      He heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd:<br /> "You, Drances,
      never want a stream of words,<br /> Then, when the public need requires our
      swords.<br /> First in the council hall to steer the state,<br /> And ever
      foremost in a tongue-debate,<br /> While our strong walls secure us from
      the foe,<br /> Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow:<br /> But let the
      potent orator declaim,<br /> And with the brand of coward blot my name;<br />
      Free leave is giv'n him, when his fatal hand<br /> Has cover'd with more
      corps the sanguine strand,<br /> And high as mine his tow'ring trophies
      stand.<br /> If any doubt remains, who dares the most,<br /> Let us decide
      it at the Trojan's cost,<br /> And issue both abreast, where honor calls-<br />
      Foes are not far to seek without the walls-<br /> Unless his noisy tongue
      can only fight,<br /> And feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight.<br />
      I beaten from the field? I forc'd away?<br /> Who, but so known a dastard,
      dares to say?<br /> Had he but ev'n beheld the fight, his eyes<br /> Had
      witness'd for me what his tongue denies:<br /> What heaps of Trojans by
      this hand were slain,<br /> And how the bloody Tiber swell'd the main.<br />
      All saw, but he, th' Arcadian troops retire<br /> In scatter'd squadrons,
      and their prince expire.<br /> The giant brothers, in their camp, have
      found,<br /> I was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground.<br /> Not such
      the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd,<br /> I singly their united arms
      oppos'd:<br /> First forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array;<br /> Then,
      glutted with their slaughter, freed my way.<br /> 'T is a destructive war?
      So let it be,<br /> But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee!<br /> Meantime
      proceed to fill the people's ears<br /> With false reports, their minds
      with panic fears:<br /> Extol the strength of a twice-conquer'd race;<br />
      Our foes encourage, and our friends debase.<br /> Believe thy fables, and
      the Trojan town<br /> Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown;<br />
      Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies,<br /> And Diomede from fierce
      Aeneas flies.<br /> Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread<br /> Runs backward
      from the sea, and hides his head,<br /> When the great Trojan on his bank
      appears;<br /> For that's as true as thy dissembled fears<br /> Of my
      revenge. Dismiss that vanity:<br /> Thou, Drances, art below a death from
      me.<br /> Let that vile soul in that vile body rest;<br /> The lodging is
      well worthy of the guest.<br />

      "Now, royal father, to the present state<br /> Of our affairs, and of this
      high debate:<br /> If in your arms thus early you diffide,<br /> And think
      your fortune is already tried;<br /> If one defeat has brought us down so
      low,<br /> As never more in fields to meet the foe;<br /> Then I conclude
      for peace: 't is time to treat,<br /> And lie like vassals at the victor's
      feet.<br /> But, O! if any ancient blood remains,<br /> One drop of all our
      fathers', in our veins,<br /> That man would I prefer before the rest,<br />
      Who dar'd his death with an undaunted breast;<br /> Who comely fell, by no
      dishonest wound,<br /> To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw'd the ground.<br />
      But, if we still have fresh recruits in store,<br /> If our confederates
      can afford us more;<br /> If the contended field we bravely fought,<br />
      And not a bloodless victory was bought;<br /> Their losses equal'd ours;
      and, for their slain,<br /> With equal fires they fill'd the shining plain;<br />
      Why thus, unforc'd, should we so tamely yield,<br /> And, ere the trumpet
      sounds, resign the field?<br /> Good unexpected, evils unforeseen,<br />
      Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene:<br /> Some, rais'd aloft,
      come tumbling down amain;<br /> Then fall so hard, they bound and rise
      again.<br /> If Diomede refuse his aid to lend,<br /> The great Messapus yet
      remains our friend:<br /> Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours;<br />
      Th' Italian chiefs and princes join their pow'rs:<br /> Nor least in
      number, nor in name the last,<br /> Your own brave subjects have your cause
      embrac'd<br /> Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon<br /> Contains an army in
      herself alone,<br /> And heads a squadron, terrible to sight,<br /> With
      glitt'ring shields, in brazen armor bright.<br /> Yet, if the foe a single
      fight demand,<br /> And I alone the public peace withstand;<br /> If you
      consent, he shall not be refus'd,<br /> Nor find a hand to victory unus'd.<br />
      This new Achilles, let him take the field,<br /> With fated armor, and
      Vulcanian shield!<br /> For you, my royal father, and my fame,<br /> I,
      Turnus, not the least of all my name,<br /> Devote my soul. He calls me
      hand to hand,<br /> And I alone will answer his demand.<br /> Drances shall
      rest secure, and neither share<br /> The danger, nor divide the prize of
      war."<br />

      While they debate, nor these nor those will yield,<br /> Aeneas draws his

      Return, and thro' the frighted city spread<br /> Th' unpleasing news, the
      Trojans are descried,<br /> In battle marching by the river side,<br /> And
      bending to the town. They take th' alarm:<br /> Some tremble, some are
      bold; all in confusion arm.<br /> Th' impetuous youth press forward to the
      field;<br /> They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:<br /> The
      fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;<br /> Old feeble men with fainter
      groans reply;<br /> A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,<br />
      Like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods,<br /> Or birds of diff'ring

      Turnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud:<br /> "Talk on, ye quaint

      calls,<br /> And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls."<br /> He said,
      and, turning short, with speedy pace,<br /> Casts back a scornful glance,
      and quits the place:<br /> "Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command<br />
      To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band.<br /> Messapus and Catillus,
      post your force<br /> Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse.<br />

      They swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town,<br /> And with disorder'd haste
      the rampires crown.<br /> Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late,<br /> The
      gath'ring storm just breaking on the state,<br /> Dismiss'd the council
      till a fitter time,<br /> And own'd his easy temper as his crime,<br /> Who,

      Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls.<br /> A sad procession
      in the streets is seen,<br /> Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:<br />
      High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,<br /> With downcast eyes,
      appears the fatal bride.<br /> They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple
      stands;<br /> Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,<br />
      With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,<br /> Then in this common
      supplication join:<br /> "O patroness of arms, unspotted maid,<br />
      Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!<br /> Break short the pirate's

      Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast<br /> Well-temper'd steel
      and scaly brass invest:<br /> The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold<br />
      Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold.<br /> His faithful fauchion sits
      upon his side;<br /> Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:<br />
      But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,<br /> With godlike grace, he
      from the tow'r descends.<br /> Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare<br />
      His absent rival, and to promise war.<br /> Freed from his keepers, thus,
      with broken reins,<br /> The wanton courser prances o'er the plains,<br />
      Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds,<br /> And snuffs the females
      in forbidden grounds.<br /> Or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood,<br />
      To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:<br /> He swims luxuriant in
      the liquid plain,<br /> And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:<br />
      He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;<br /> Before his ample

      Soon as the prince appears without the gate,<br /> The Volscians, with

      squadron imitates, and each descends;<br /> Whose common suit Camilla thus
      commends:<br /> "If sense of honor, if a soul secure<br /> Of inborn worth,
      that can all tests endure,<br /> Can promise aught, or on itself rely<br />
      Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;<br /> Then, I alone, sustain'd by

      Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:<br /> You, gen'ral, stay behind,

      Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,<br /> And on the fierce

      my breast,<br /> But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd.<br /> Yet
      rob me not of all; but let me join<br /> My toils, my hazard, and my fame,
      with thine.<br /> The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd,<br /> Sends his
      light horse before to scour the field:<br /> Himself, thro' steep ascents
      and thorny brakes,<br /> A larger compass to the city takes.<br /> This news
      my scouts confirm, and I prepare<br /> To foil his cunning, and his force
      to dare;<br /> With chosen foot his passage to forelay,<br /> And place an
      ambush in the winding way.<br /> Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan
      horse;<br /> The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce<br /> With those of
      Tibur, and the Latian band,<br /> Subjected all to thy supreme command."<br />
      This said, he warns Messapus to the war,<br /> Then ev'ry chief exhorts
      with equal care.<br /> All thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins,<br />
      And hastes to prosecute his deep designs.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies,<br /> By nature form'd for
      fraud, and fitted for surprise.<br /> A narrow track, by human steps
      untrode,<br /> Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode.<br />
      High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,<br /> Whence the surveying
      sight the nether ground commands.<br /> The top is level, an offensive seat<br />
      Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:<br /> For, on the right and left,
      is room to press<br /> The foes at hand, or from afar distress;<br /> To
      drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour<br /> On their descending backs a
      stony show'r.<br /> Thither young Turnus took the well-known way,<br />
      Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,<br /> Beheld th' approaching war
      with hateful eyes,<br /> And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid,<br />
      Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;<br /> Then with a sigh began:
      "Camilla goes<br /> To meet her death amidst her fatal foes:<br /> The
      nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train,<br /> Invested with Diana's arms, in
      vain.<br /> Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:<br /> 'T was born with
      her; and with her years it grew.<br /> Her father Metabus, when forc'd away<br />
      From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,<br /> Snatch'd up, and sav'd from
      his prevailing foes,<br /> This tender babe, companion of his woes.<br />
      Casmilla was her mother; but he drown'd<br /> One hissing letter in a
      softer sound,<br /> And call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies;<br />
      Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies.<br /> His foes in sight, he
      mends his weary pace;<br /> With shout and clamors they pursue the chase.<br />
      The banks of Amasene at length he gains:<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The raging flood his farther flight restrains,<br /> Rais'd o'er the
      borders with unusual rains.<br /> Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he
      fears,<br /> Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.<br /> Anxious, he
      stops a while, and thinks in haste;<br /> Then, desp'rate in distress,
      resolves at last.<br /> A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore;<br /> The
      middle part with cork he cover'd o'er:<br /> He clos'd the child within the
      hollow space;<br /> With twigs of bending osier bound the case;<br /> Then
      pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight,<br /> And thus invok'd my favor
      for the freight:<br /> 'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said,<br />
      'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!<br /> Thro' air she flies a
      suppliant to thy shrine;<br /> And the first weapons that she knows, are
      thine.'<br /> He said; and with full force the spear he threw:<br /> Above
      the sounding waves Camilla flew.<br /> Then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd
      the stormy tide,<br /> And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side.<br />
      His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground,<br /> And, victor of his
      vows, his infant nymph unbound;<br /> Nor, after that, in towns which walls
      inclose,<br /> Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;<br /> But,
      rough, in open air he chose to lie;<br /> Earth was his couch, his cov'ring
      was the sky.<br /> On hills unshorn, or in a desart den,<br /> He shunn'd
      the dire society of men.<br /> A shepherd's solitary life he led;<br /> His
      daughter with the milk of mares he fed.<br /> The dugs of bears, and ev'ry
      salvage beast,<br /> He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd.<br />
      The little Amazon could scarcely go:<br /> He loads her with a quiver and a
      bow;<br /> And, that she might her stagg'ring steps command,<br /> He with a
      slender jav'lin fills her hand.<br /> Her flowing hair no golden fillet
      bound;<br /> Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.<br /> Instead of
      these, a tiger's hide o'erspread<br /> Her back and shoulders, fasten'd to
      her head.<br /> The flying dart she first attempts to fling,<br /> And round
      her tender temples toss'd the sling;<br /> Then, as her strength with years
      increas'd, began<br /> To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,<br /> And
      from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.<br /> The Tuscan matrons
      with each other vied,<br /> To bless their rival sons with such a bride;<br />
      But she disdains their love, to share with me<br /> The sylvan shades and
      vow'd virginity.<br /> And, O! I wish, contented with my cares<br /> Of
      salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!<br /> Then had she been of my
      celestial train,<br /> And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain.<br />
      But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes<br /> To find her death among
      forbidden foes,<br /> Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.<br />
      Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.<br /> This bow to thee,
      this quiver I bequeath,<br /> This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:<br />
      By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain,<br /> Or of the Trojan or Italian
      train,<br /> Let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain.<br /> Then, in a
      hollow cloud, myself will aid<br /> To bear the breathless body of my maid:<br />
      Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd<br /> Her holy limbs with any
      human hand,<br /> And in a marble tomb laid in her native land."<br />

      By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse,<br /> Drawn up in squadrons, with

      and spears flash horribly from far;<br /> And the fields glitter with a
      waving war.<br /> Oppos'd to these, come on with furious force<br />
      Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;<br /> These in the body plac'd, on
      either hand<br /> Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band.<br />
      Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;<br /> And less and less the
      middle space appears.<br /> Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are
      seen<br /> The neighing coursers, and the shouting men.<br /> In distance of
      their darts they stop their course;<br /> Then man to man they rush, and
      horse to horse.<br /> The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide,<br />
      And deaths unseen are dealt on either side.<br /> Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus,
      void of fear,<br /> By mettled coursers borne in full career,<br /> Meet

      each other knock.<br /> Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast,<br /> As
      with an engine's force, or lightning's blast:<br /> He rolls along in
      blood, and breathes his last.<br /> The Latin squadrons take a sudden
      fright,<br /> And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight<br />
      Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;<br /> Close in the rear the
      Tuscan troops pursue,<br /> And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;<br />
      Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face,<br /> Receive their
      foes, and raise a threat'ning cry.<br /> The Tuscans take their turn to
      fear and fly.<br /> So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar,<br /> Driv'n
      on each other's backs, insult the shore,<br /> Bound o'er the rocks,
      incroach upon the land,<br /> And far upon the beach eject the sand;<br />
      Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,<br /> Repuls'd from upper
      ground, and seek their mother sea;<br /> With equal hurry quit th' invaded
      shore,<br /> And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,<br /> Twice by the Latins, in
      their turn, repell'd.<br /> Asham'd at length, to the third charge they
      ran;<br /> Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man.<br /> Now dying
      groans are heard; the fields are strow'd<br /> With falling bodies, and are
      drunk with blood.<br /> Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie:<br />
      Confus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry.<br /> Orsilochus, who durst
      not press too near<br /> Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear,<br />
      And stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear.<br /> The fiery steed,
      impatient of the wound,<br /> Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound,<br />
      His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.<br /> Catillus pierc'd Iolas
      first; then drew<br /> His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,<br /> The
      mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.<br /> His neck and throat unarm'd, his
      head was bare,<br /> But shaded with a length of yellow hair:<br /> Secure,
      he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part,<br /> A spacious mark for swords, and for
      the flying dart.<br /> Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound;<br />
      Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground.<br /> The sands with
      streaming blood are sanguine dyed,<br /> And death with honor sought on
      either side.<br />

      Resistless thro' the war Camilla rode,<br /> In danger unappall'd, and

      jav'lins play;<br /> Now with her ax's edge she hews her way:<br /> Diana's
      arms upon her shoulder sound;<br /> And when, too closely press'd, she
      quits the ground,<br /> From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.<br />
      Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,<br /> Larina, Tulla, fierce
      Tarpeia, ride:<br /> Italians all; in peace, their queen's delight;<br /> In
      war, the bold companions of the fight.<br /> So march'd the Tracian Amazons
      of old,<br /> When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd:<br /> Such troops
      as these in shining arms were seen,<br /> When Theseus met in fight their
      maiden queen:<br /> Such to the field Penthisilea led,<br /> From the fierce
      virgin when the Grecians fled;<br /> With such, return'd triumphant from
      the war,<br /> Her maids with cries attend the lofty car;<br /> They clash
      with manly force their moony shields;<br /> With female shouts resound the
      Phrygian fields.<br />

      Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,<br /> On the cold earth were by
      thy courage laid?<br /> Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,<br />
      With fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd:<br /> A purple stream
      came spouting from the wound;<br /> Bath'd in his blood he lies, and bites
      the ground.<br /> Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:<br /> The former, as
      the slacken'd reins he drew<br /> Of his faint steed; the latter, as he
      stretch'd<br /> His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd.<br /> By
      the same weapon, sent from the same hand,<br /> Both fall together, and
      both spurn the sand.<br /> Amastrus next is added to the slain:<br /> The
      rest in rout she follows o'er the plain:<br /> Tereus, Harpalycus,
      Demophoon,<br /> And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun.<br /> Of all her
      deadly darts, not one she lost;<br /> Each was attended with a Trojan
      ghost.<br /> Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,<br /> Swift for the
      chase, and of Apulian breed.<br /> Him from afar she spied, in arms
      unknown:<br /> O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown;<br /> His helm a
      wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread<br /> A cov'ring for his cheeks, and
      grinn'd around his head,<br /> He clench'd within his hand an iron prong,<br />
      And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.<br /> Him soon she
      singled from the flying train,<br /> And slew with ease; then thus insults
      the slain:<br /> "Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase<br />
      The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?<br /> Here cease thy vaunts,
      and own my victory:<br /> A woman warrior was too strong for thee.<br />
      Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name,<br /> Confessing great
      Camilla, save thy shame."<br /> Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,<br />
      The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;<br /> But Butes breast to breast:
      the spear descends<br /> Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,<br /> And
      o'er the shield which his left side defends.<br /> Orsilochus and she their
      courses ply:<br /> He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;<br /> But in a
      narrower ring she makes the race;<br /> And then he flies, and she pursues
      the chase.<br /> Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe,<br /> She swings
      her ax, and rises to the blow<br /> Full on the helm behind, with such a
      sway<br /> The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:<br /> He groans, he
      roars, he sues in vain for grace;<br /> Brains, mingled with his blood,
      besmear his face.<br />

      Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance,<br /> To see his fall; nor farther
      dares advance;<br /> But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,<br /> He
      stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;<br /> Yet, like a true
      Ligurian, born to cheat,<br /> (At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,)<br />
      Cries out aloud: "What courage have you shown,<br /> Who trust your
      courser's strength, and not your own?<br /> Forego the vantage of your
      horse, alight,<br /> And then on equal terms begin the fight:<br /> It shall
      be seen, weak woman, what you can,<br /> When, foot to foot, you combat
      with a man,"<br /> He said. She glows with anger and disdain,<br />
      Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,<br /> And leaves her horse
      at large among her train;<br /> With her drawn sword defies him to the
      field,<br /> And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield.<br /> The youth,
      who thought his cunning did succeed,<br /> Reins round his horse, and urges
      all his speed;<br /> Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides<br /> The
      goring rowels in his bleeding sides.<br /> "Vain fool, and coward!" cries
      the lofty maid,<br /> "Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid!<br />
      On others practice thy Ligurian arts;<br /> Thin stratagems and tricks of
      little hearts<br /> Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,<br /> With
      vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire."<br /> At this, so fast her flying
      feet she sped,<br /> That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head:<br />
      Then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein,<br /> And laid the boaster
      grov'ling on the plain.<br /> Not with more ease the falcon, from above,<br />
      Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,<br /> Then plumes the prey, in
      her strong pounces bound:<br /> The feathers, foul with blood, come
      tumbling to the ground.<br />

      Now mighty Jove, from his superior height,<br /> With his broad eye surveys

      the Tuscan rides,<br /> And these encourages, and those he chides;<br />
      Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight;<br /> Renews their ardor,

      by night,<br /> Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite;<br /> When
      to fat off'rings the glad augur calls,<br /> And the shrill hornpipe sounds
      to bacchanals.<br /> These are your studied cares, your lewd delight:<br />
      Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight."<br /> Thus having said, he
      spurs amid the foes,<br /> Not managing the life he meant to lose.<br /> The
      first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste,<br /> In his strong gripe,
      and clasp'd around the waist;<br /> 'T was Venulus, whom from his horse he
      tore,<br /> And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore.<br /> Loud shouts
      ensue; the Latins turn their eyes,<br /> And view th' unusual sight with
      vast surprise.<br /> The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains,<br />
      Press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains;<br /> Then, with his
      shorten'd spear, explores around<br /> His jointed arms, to fix a deadly
      wound.<br /> Nor less the captive struggles for his life:<br /> He writhes
      his body to prolong the strife,<br /> And, fencing for his naked throat,
      exerts<br /> His utmost vigor, and the point averts.<br /> So stoops the
      yellow eagle from on high,<br /> And bears a speckled serpent thro' the
      sky,<br /> Fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey:<br /> The pris'ner
      hisses thro' the liquid way;<br /> Resists the royal hawk; and, tho'
      oppress'd,<br /> She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:<br /> Turn'd
      to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale,<br /> And shoots her forky tongue,
      and whisks her threat'ning tail.<br /> Against the victor, all defense is
      weak:<br /> Th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak;<br /> He tears
      her bowels, and her breast he gores;<br /> Then claps his pinions, and
      securely soars.<br /> Thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies,<br />
      Strong Tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize.<br /> The Tyrrhene troops,
      that shrunk before, now press<br /> The Latins, and presume the like

      sound advice, proceeding from a heart<br /> Sincerely yours, and free from
      fraudful art.<br /> The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,<br /> No
      prince Italian born should heir my throne:<br /> Oft have our augurs, in
      prediction skill'd,<br /> And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd.<br />
      Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,<br /> Brib'd by my kindness to

      fate?<br /> If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,<br /> Why should I
      not procure it whilst you live?<br /> Should I to doubtful arms your youth
      betray,<br /> What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say?<br /> And, should you
      fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!)<br /> How curse the cause which
      hasten'd to his end<br /> The daughter's lover and the father's friend?<br />

      fathers, which you take<br /> For my concerns, at my desire forsake.<br />
      Permit me not to languish out my days,<br /> But make the best exchange of
      life for praise.<br /> This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;<br />
      And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.<br /> His goddess mother is
      not near, to shroud<br /> The flying coward with an empty cloud."<br />

      But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life,<br /> And loath'd the hard

      by these tears,<br /> And whate'er price Amata's honor bears<br /> Within
      thy breast, since thou art all my hope,<br /> My sickly mind's repose, my

      Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:<br /> Refuse me not this one, this
      only pray'r,<br /> To waive the combat, and pursue the war.<br /> Whatever
      chance attends this fatal strife,<br /> Think it includes, in thine,
      Amata's life.<br /> I cannot live a slave, or see my throne<br /> Usurp'd by

      the flames,<br /> And all those pow'rs attest, and all their names;<br />
      Whatever chance befall on either side,<br /> No term of time this union
      shall divide:<br /> No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind,<br /> Or
      shake the steadfast tenor of my mind;<br /> Not tho' the circling seas
      should break their bound,<br /> O'erflow the shores, or sap the solid
      ground;<br /> Not tho' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake,<br />
      Hurl'd down, and hissing in the nether lake:<br /> Ev'n as this royal

      Undaunted to the battle if we go,<br /> Scarce ev'ry second man will share
      a foe.<br /> Turnus, 't is true, in this unequal strife,<br /> Shall lose,
      with honor, his devoted life,<br /> Or change it rather for immortal fame,<br />
      Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:<br /> But you, a servile and
      inglorious band,<br /> For foreign lords shall sow your native land,<br />
      Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd,<br /> Which have so

      city troops, and Latians, tir'd<br /> With tedious war, seem with new souls
      inspir'd:<br /> Their champion's fate with pity they lament,<br /> And of

      The God of Battles, in his angry mood,<br /> Clashing his sword against his
      brazen shield,<br /> Let loose the reins, and scours along the field:<br />
      Before the wind his fiery coursers fly;<br /> Groans the sad earth,
      resounds the rattling sky.<br /> Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and
      Despair<br /> (Dire faces, and deform'd) surround the car;<br /> Friends of

      disdain,<br /> Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:<br /> His smoking
      horses, at their utmost speed,<br /> He lashes on, and urges o'er the dead.<br />
      Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,<br /> The gore and
      gath'ring dust are dash'd around.<br /> Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the

      Imbracus he slew,<br /> Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew;<br /> Both

      To this, the prince: "O sister- for I knew<br /> The peace infring'd
      proceeded first from you;<br /> I knew you, when you mingled first in
      fight;<br /> And now in vain you would deceive my sight-<br /> Why, goddess,
      this unprofitable care?<br /> Who sent you down from heav'n, involv'd in
      air,<br /> Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain,<br /> And see your
      brother bleeding on the plain?<br /> For to what pow'r can Turnus have
      recourse,<br /> Or how resist his fate's prevailing force?<br /> These eyes
      beheld Murranus bite the ground:<br /> Mighty the man, and mighty was the
      wound.<br /> I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,<br /> My name
      invoking to revenge his death.<br /> Brave Ufens fell with honor on the
      place,<br /> To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.<br /> On earth
      supine, a manly corpse he lies;<br /> His vest and armor are the victor's
      prize.<br /> Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame,<br /> Which only
      wanted, to complete my shame?<br /> How will the Latins hoot their
      champion's flight!<br /> How Drances will insult and point them to the
      sight!<br /> Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below,<br /> (Since those
      above so small compassion show,)<br /> Receive a soul unsullied yet with
      shame,<br /> Which not belies my great forefather's name!"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed<br /> Came Sages urging on
      his foamy steed:<br /> Fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,<br /> And,
      seeking Turnus, sent his voice before:<br /> "Turnus, on you, on you alone,
      depends<br /> Our last relief: compassionate your friends!<br /> Like
      lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on,<br /> With arms invests, with flames
      invades the town:<br /> The brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire<br />
      To drive along the deluge of the fire.<br /> All eyes are fix'd on you:
      your foes rejoice;<br /> Ev'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;<br />
      Doubts to deliver or defend the town,<br /> Whom to reject, or whom to call
      his son.<br /> The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd,<br />
      Herself suborning death, has breath'd her last.<br /> 'T is true, Messapus,
      fearless of his fate,<br /> With fierce Atinas' aid, defends the gate:<br />
      On ev'ry side surrounded by the foe,<br /> The more they kill, the greater
      numbers grow;<br /> An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow.<br />
      You, far aloof from your forsaken bands,<br /> Your rolling chariot drive
      o'er empty sands.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin'd,<br /> And various cares
      revolving in his mind:<br /> Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast,<br />
      And sorrow mix'd with shame, his soul oppress'd;<br /> And conscious worth
      lay lab'ring in his thought,<br /> And love by jealousy to madness wrought.<br />
      By slow degrees his reason drove away<br /> The mists of passion, and
      resum'd her sway.<br /> Then, rising on his car, he turn'd his look,<br />
      And saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke.<br /> A wooden tow'r with
      flames already blaz'd,<br /> Which his own hands on beams and rafters
      rais'd;<br /> And bridges laid above to join the space,<br /> And wheels
      below to roll from place to place.<br /> "Sister, the Fates have
      vanquish'd: let us go<br /> The way which Heav'n and my hard fortune show.<br />
      The fight is fix'd; nor shall the branded name<br /> Of a base coward blot
      your brother's fame.<br /> Death is my choice; but suffer me to try<br /> My
      force, and vent my rage before I die."<br /> He said; and, leaping down
      without delay,<br /> Thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way.<br />
      Striding he pass'd, impetuous as the wind,<br /> And left the grieving
      goddess far behind.<br /> As when a fragment, from a mountain torn<br /> By
      raging tempests, or by torrents borne,<br /> Or sapp'd by time, or loosen'd
      from the roots-<br /> Prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots,<br />
      Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;<br /> Down sink, at once,
      the shepherds and their sheep:<br /> Involv'd alike, they rush to nether
      ground;<br /> Stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth
      rebound:<br /> So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town,<br /> Should'ring
      and shoving, bore the squadrons down.<br /> Still pressing onward, to the
      walls he drew,<br /> Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew,<br />
      And sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue.<br /> First stretching out
      his arm, in sign of peace,<br /> He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:<br />
      "Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire!<br /> The fight is mine; and me
      the gods require.<br /> 'T is just that I should vindicate alone<br /> The
      broken truce, or for the breach atone.<br /> This day shall free from wars
      th' Ausonian state,<br /> Or finish my misfortunes in my fate."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Both armies from their bloody work desist,<br /> And, bearing backward,
      form a spacious list.<br /> The Trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame<br />
      The welcome sound, and heard the champion's name,<br /> Soon leaves the
      taken works and mounted walls,<br /> Greedy of war where greater glory
      calls.<br /> He springs to fight, exulting in his force<br /> His jointed
      armor rattles in the course.<br /> Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he
      shows,<br /> Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows,<br /> His head
      divine obscure in clouds he hides,<br /> And shakes the sounding forest on
      his sides.<br /> The nations, overaw'd, surcease the fight;<br /> Immovable
      their bodies, fix'd their sight.<br /> Ev'n death stands still; nor from
      above they throw<br /> Their darts, nor drive their batt'ring-rams below.<br />
      In silent order either army stands,<br /> And drop their swords, unknowing,
      from their hands.<br /> Th' Ausonian king beholds, with wond'ring sight,<br />
      Two mighty champions match'd in single fight,<br /> Born under climes
      remote, and brought by fate,<br /> With swords to try their titles to the
      state.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Now, in clos'd field, each other from afar<br /> They view; and, rushing
      on, begin the war.<br /> They launch their spears; then hand to hand they
      meet;<br /> The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:<br /> Their
      bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,<br /> And flakes of fire
      from their hard helmets fly.<br /> Courage conspires with chance, and both
      ingage<br /> With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.<br /> As when two
      bulls for their fair female fight<br /> In Sila's shades, or on Taburnus'
      height;<br /> With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;<br /> Mute
      stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,<br /> And wait th' event;
      which victor they shall bear,<br /> And who shall be the lord, to rule the
      lusty year:<br /> With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,<br /> And push
      for push, and wound for wound return;<br /> Their dewlaps gor'd, their
      sides are lav'd in blood;<br /> Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow
      thro' the wood:<br /> Such was the combat in the listed ground;<br /> So
      clash their swords, and so their shields resound.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays<br /> The champions' fate, and
      each exactly weighs.<br /> On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;<br />
      Loaded with death, that other scale descends.<br /> Rais'd on the stretch,
      young Turnus aims a blow<br /> Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:<br />
      Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side,<br /> As hopes and fears
      their panting hearts divide.<br /> But all in pieces flies the traitor
      sword,<br /> And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.<br /> Now is but
      death, or flight; disarm'd he flies,<br /> When in his hand an unknown hilt
      he spies.<br /> Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd,<br />
      Hurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind,<br /> Snatch'd the first weapon
      which his haste could find.<br /> 'T was not the fated sword his father
      bore,<br /> But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.<br /> This, while the
      Trojans fled, the toughness held;<br /> But, vain against the great
      Vulcanian shield,<br /> The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:<br />
      The shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,<br /> And now forthright, and
      now in orbits wheel'd;<br /> For here the Trojan troops the list surround,<br />
      And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.<br /> Aeneas
      hastens, tho' with heavier pace-<br /> His wound, so newly knit, retards
      the chase,<br /> And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse-<br /> Yet,
      pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around<br /> With crimson toils, or in
      a river found,<br /> High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears,<br />
      Still opening, following still, where'er he steers;<br /> The persecuted
      creature, to and fro,<br /> Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:<br />
      Steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land,<br /> The purple death is
      pitch'd along the strand.<br /> His eager foe, determin'd to the chase,<br />
      Stretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace;<br /> Now to his beamy
      head he makes his way,<br /> And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his
      prey:<br /> Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;<br /> He
      bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:<br /> The rocks, the
      lakes, the meadows ring with cries;<br /> The mortal tumult mounts, and
      thunders in the skies.<br /> Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying,
      blames<br /> His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,<br /> Demands
      his trusty sword. The Trojan threats<br /> The realm with ruin, and their
      ancient seats<br /> To lay in ashes, if they dare supply<br /> With arms or
      aid his vanquish'd enemy:<br /> Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,<br />
      With vigor, tho' diminish'd of his force.<br /> Ten times already round the
      listed place<br /> One chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase:<br />
      No trivial prize is play'd; for on the life<br /> Or death of Turnus now
      depends the strife.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Within the space, an olive tree had stood,<br /> A sacred shade, a
      venerable wood,<br /> For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god.<br />
      Here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd,<br /> Of sinking mariners
      from shipwrack sav'd.<br /> With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the
      tree,<br /> To make the ground inclos'd for combat free.<br /> Deep in the
      root, whether by fate, or chance,<br /> Or erring haste, the Trojan drove
      his lance;<br /> Then stoop'd, and tugg'd with force immense, to free<br />
      Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree;<br /> That, whom his fainting
      limbs pursued in vain,<br /> His flying weapon might from far attain.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid,<br /> Then Turnus to the gods, and
      first to Faunus pray'd:<br /> "O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,<br />
      Where I thy foster son receiv'd my birth,<br /> Hold fast the steel! If my
      religious hand<br /> Your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd,<br />
      Propitious hear my pious pray'r!" He said,<br /> Nor with successless vows
      invok'd their aid.<br /> Th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and
      strain'd;<br /> But still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd.<br />
      Juturna took her time; and, while in vain<br /> He strove, assum'd Meticus'
      form again,<br /> And, in that imitated shape, restor'd<br /> To the
      despairing prince his Daunian sword.<br /> The Queen of Love, who, with
      disdain and grief,<br /> Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,<br />
      T' assert her offspring with a greater deed,<br /> From the tough root the
      ling'ring weapon freed.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:<br /> One trusts the sword, and
      one the pointed lance;<br /> And both resolv'd alike to try their fatal
      chance.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,<br /> Who from a shining cloud beheld
      the shock:<br /> "What new arrest, O Queen of Heav'n, is sent<br /> To stop
      the Fates now lab'ring in th' event?<br /> What farther hopes are left thee
      to pursue?<br /> Divine Aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,)<br /> Foredoom'd,
      to these celestial seats are due.<br /> What more attempts for Turnus can
      be made,<br /> That thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?<br /> Is it
      becoming of the due respect<br /> And awful honor of a god elect,<br /> A
      wound unworthy of our state to feel,<br /> Patient of human hands and
      earthly steel?<br /> Or seems it just, the sister should restore<br /> A
      second sword, when one was lost before,<br /> And arm a conquer'd wretch
      against his conqueror?<br /> For what, without thy knowledge and avow,<br />
      Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?<br /> At last, in deference to my
      love, forbear<br /> To lodge within thy soul this anxious care;<br />
      Reclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload:<br /> Who should relieve the
      goddess, but the god?<br /> Now all things to their utmost issue tend,<br />
      Push'd by the Fates to their appointed<br /> While leave was giv'n thee,
      and a lawful hour<br /> For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r,<br />
      Toss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,<br /> And, driv'n
      ashore, with hostile arms oppress;<br /> Deform the royal house; and, from
      the side<br /> Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:<br /> Now
      cease at my command." The Thund'rer said;<br /> And, with dejected eyes,
      this answer Juno made:<br /> "Because your dread decree too well I knew,<br />
      From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew.<br /> Else should you not
      behold me here, alone,<br /> Involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,<br />
      But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight<br /> Engag'd against my foes
      in mortal fight.<br /> 'T is true, Juturna mingled in the strife<br /> By my
      command, to save her brother's life-<br /> At least to try; but, by the
      Stygian lake,<br /> (The most religious oath the gods can take,)<br /> With
      this restriction, not to bend the bow,<br /> Or toss the spear, or
      trembling dart to throw.<br /> And now, resign'd to your superior might,<br />
      And tir'd with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.<br /> This let me beg
      (and this no fates withstand)<br /> Both for myself and for your father's
      land,<br /> That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,<br /> (Which I,
      since you ordain, consent to bless,)<br /> The laws of either nation be the
      same;<br /> But let the Latins still retain their name,<br /> Speak the same
      language which they spoke before,<br /> Wear the same habits which their
      grandsires wore.<br /> Call them not Trojans: perish the renown<br /> And
      name of Troy, with that detested town.<br /> Latium be Latium still; let
      Alba reign<br /> And Rome's immortal majesty remain."<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Then thus the founder of mankind replies<br /> (Unruffled was his front,
      serene his eyes)<br /> "Can Saturn's issue, and heav'n's other heir,<br />
      Such endless anger in her bosom bear?<br /> Be mistress, and your full
      desires obtain;<br /> But quench the choler you foment in vain.<br /> From
      ancient blood th' Ausonian people sprung,<br /> Shall keep their name,
      their habit, and their tongue.<br /> The Trojans to their customs shall be
      tied:<br /> I will, myself, their common rites provide;<br /> The natives
      shall command, the foreigners subside.<br /> All shall be Latium; Troy
      without a name;<br /> And her lost sons forget from whence they came.<br />
      From blood so mix'd, a pious race shall flow,<br /> Equal to gods,
      excelling all below.<br /> No nation more respect to you shall pay,<br /> Or
      greater off'rings on your altars lay."<br /> Juno consents, well pleas'd
      that her desires<br /> Had found success, and from the cloud retires.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The peace thus made, the Thund'rer next prepares<br /> To force the wat'ry
      goddess from the wars.<br /> Deep in the dismal regions void of light,<br />
      Three daughters at a birth were born to Night:<br /> These their brown
      mother, brooding on her care,<br /> Indued with windy wings to flit in air,<br />
      With serpents girt alike, and crown'd with hissing hair.<br /> In heav'n
      the Dirae call'd, and still at hand,<br /> Before the throne of angry Jove
      they stand,<br /> His ministers of wrath, and ready still<br /> The minds of
      mortal men with fears to fill,<br /> Whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his
      hate<br /> On realms or towns deserving of their fate,<br /> Hurls down
      diseases, death and deadly care,<br /> And terrifies the guilty world with
      war.<br /> One sister plague if these from heav'n he sent,<br /> To fright
      Juturna with a dire portent.<br /> The pest comes whirling down: by far
      more slow<br /> Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow,<br /> Or
      Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,<br /> And drench'd in pois'nous
      juice, the sure destruction flies.<br /> With such a sudden and unseen a
      flight<br /> Shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night.<br /> Soon as
      the field inclos'd she had in view,<br /> And from afar her destin'd quarry
      knew,<br /> Contracted, to the boding bird she turns,<br /> Which haunts the
      ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns,<br /> And beats about the tombs with
      nightly wings,<br /> Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.<br /> Thus
      lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries<br /> The Fury round unhappy
      Turnus flies,<br /> Flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      A lazy chillness crept along his blood;<br /> Chok'd was his voice; his
      hair with horror stood.<br /> Juturna from afar beheld her fly,<br /> And
      knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry<br /> And stridor of her wings.
      Amaz'd with fear,<br /> Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing
      hair.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      "Ah me!" she cries, "in this unequal strife<br /> What can thy sister more
      to save thy life?<br /> Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend<br /> In arms
      with that inexorable fiend?<br /> Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to
      fright<br /> My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;<br /> The lashing of
      your wings I know too well,<br /> The sounding flight, and fun'ral screams
      of hell!<br /> These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove,<br /> The
      worthy recompense of ravish'd love!<br /> Did he for this exempt my life
      from fate?<br /> O hard conditions of immortal state,<br /> Tho' born to
      death, not privileg'd to die,<br /> But forc'd to bear impos'd eternity!<br />
      Take back your envious bribes, and let me go<br /> Companion to my
      brother's ghost below!<br /> The joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains,<br />
      Of life immortal, but immortal pains.<br /> What earth will open her
      devouring womb,<br /> To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!"<br /> She drew a
      length of sighs; nor more she said,<br /> But in her azure mantle wrapp'd
      her head,<br /> Then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair,<br /> And
      her last sobs came bubbling up in air.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear<br /> Against his foe, and thus upbraids
      his fear:<br /> "What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?<br /> What empty
      hopes are harbor'd in his mind?<br /> 'T is not thy swiftness can secure
      thy flight;<br /> Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.<br />
      Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare<br /> What skill and courage can
      attempt in war;<br /> Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;<br />
      Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!"<br /> The champion shook his head,
      and made this short reply:<br /> "No threats of thine my manly mind can
      move;<br /> 'T is hostile heav'n I dread, and partial Jove."<br /> He said
      no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd<br /> The mighty sorrow in his
      swelling breast.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Then, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around,<br /> An antique stone he saw,
      the common bound<br /> Of neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the ground;<br />
      So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days<br /> Th' enormous weight
      from earth could hardly raise.<br /> He heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on
      high,<br /> Ran stagg'ring on against his enemy,<br /> But so disorder'd,
      that he scarcely knew<br /> His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw.<br />
      His knocking knees are bent beneath the load,<br /> And shiv'ring cold
      congeals his vital blood.<br /> The stone drops from his arms, and, falling
      short<br /> For want of vigor, mocks his vain effort.<br /> And as, when
      heavy sleep has clos'd the sight,<br /> The sickly fancy labors in the
      night;<br /> We seem to run; and, destitute of force,<br /> Our sinking
      limbs forsake us in the course:<br /> In vain we heave for breath; in vain
      we cry;<br /> The nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny;<br /> And on
      the tongue the falt'ring accents die:<br /> So Turnus far'd; whatever means
      he tried,<br /> All force of arms and points of art employ'd,<br /> The Fury
      flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;<br /> He star'd about, nor
      aid nor issue found;<br /> His own men stop the pass, and his own walls
      surround.<br /> Once more he pauses, and looks out again,<br /> And seeks
      the goddess charioteer in vain.<br /> Trembling he views the thund'ring
      chief advance,<br /> And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:<br /> Amaz'd he
      cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe,<br /> Forgets to ward, and waits the
      coming blow.<br /> Astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with fear,<br />
      Aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      The hero measur'd first, with narrow view,<br /> The destin'd mark; and,
      rising as he threw,<br /> With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.<br />
      Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,<br /> Or stones from
      batt'ring-engines break the walls:<br /> Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm
      so strong,<br /> The lance drove on, and bore the death along.<br /> Naught
      could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail,<br /> Nor aught, beneath his
      arms, the coat of mail:<br /> It pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound<br />
      Transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground.<br /> With groans the
      Latins rend the vaulted sky:<br /> Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice
      reply.<br />

      Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,<br /> With eyes cast upward, and
      with arms display'd,<br /> And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd:<br />
      "I know my death deserv'd, nor hope to live:<br /> Use what the gods and
      thy good fortune give.<br /> Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown-<br />
      Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son-<br /> Pity my sire, now sinking

      vow'd revenge pursue my death,<br /> Give to my friends my body void of
      breath!<br /> The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;<br /> Thine is the

      His manly soul with more compassion melt;<br /> When, casting down a casual
      glance, he spied<br /> The golden belt that glitter'd on his side,<br /> The

      my friend?<br /> To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!<br /> 'T is Pallas,
      Pallas gives this deadly blow."<br /> He rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the
      word,<br /> Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.<br /> The streaming
      blood distain'd his arms around,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
