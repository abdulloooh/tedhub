    <p><em>Last updated 10/21/2010 </em><br /><br /> Welcome to GCFLearnFree.org&reg;. By accessing, browsing and/or using this website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by and comply with all terms in this statement. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use this website.<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Using Our Program</h4>
<p><br /> All learning opportunities at GCFLearnFree.org&mdash;tutorials, classes, articles, videos modules, and interactive lessons&mdash;are completely free to all users, and no user should ever have to create an account with an outside agency or pay a fee to use our site.<br /><br /> All of the content on the GCFLearnFree.org website is copyright protected. We recognize that learners may want to print or download website content for a variety of educational reasons. These uses are permissible as long as the content is used for noncommercial purposes (and for no personal financial benefit), that content is not altered or transformed in any way, that GCFLearnFree.org&reg; is acknowledged as the owner and copyright holder of the content, and that a link is provided to our website.<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Marketing &amp; Linking</h4>
<p><br />Agencies and organizations are welcome to add a link to GCFLearnFree.org on their websites, but they may not use our website within a browser frame or in any other way that would give a false impression of affiliation or website ownership. If you wish to add a link to our website, please follow the directions for doing so at the bottom of our <a title="Media Kit" href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/newsroom/media-kit" target="_self">Media Kit</a> page, where you will find the appropriate HTML code and graphics to create the link.<br /><br /> Agencies and organizations are also welcome to use Goodwill Community Foundation, Inc. (GCF) marks in advertising, media releases, and other promotional material that discuss our curriculum.

<h4>Submitted Content</h4>
<p><br />By submitting content to GCFLearnFree.org, you agree to grant to GCFLearnFree.org and its affiliates, free of charge, permission to use the content.

<h4>Online Classes</h4>
<p><br /><em>Accounts.</em> A GCFLearnFree.org account must be created in order to register for online classes and view related class history and transcripts. Only one account should be created; we cannot combine information from multiple accounts. Please do not share your user name and password with others or use another user's account to sign in. Once an account is created, it cannot be deleted if you have earned CEUs (we are obligated by IACET to maintain CEU transcripts for up to seven years). We reserve the right to deactivate a user's account for violating the terms of this website or for any reason we deem appropriate.<br /><br /> <em>Privacy</em>. Privacy protection is important at GCFLearnFree.org, and we want you to know that we make sure your personal information remains confidential. GCFLearnFree.org will not release individual records to outside agencies for any reason. Users have access to their own class records and are responsible for their release. Learner records are stored in a secure database for a minimum of seven years.<br /><br /> <em>Class Communication.</em> Class communication includes the Message Center, class assignments, and any other communication between you and the GCFLearnFree.org staff. All class communication should be limited to information related to class material or the GCFLearnFree.org website. We ask that you not intentionally post information that is false, harmful, obscene, or that violates a person's right to privacy; any applicable local, state, national or international law; or that is inappropriate or irrelevant to our training. The GCFLearnFree.org staff does not tolerate inappropriate comments and reserves the right to determine what constitutes inappropriate language. If information of this nature is posted, GCFLearnFree.org has the right to drop a learner from a class and/or suspend a learner's account. By registering and participating in a GCFLearnFree.org class, you are consenting to these terms.<br /><br /></p>
